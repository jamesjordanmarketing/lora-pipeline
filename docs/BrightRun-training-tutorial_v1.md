---

## Getting Started

### Access the Platform

1. **Login:** Navigate to `/signin`
2. **Dashboard:** You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` after login

### Navigation Overview

**Main Dashboard Sections:**
- **Datasets** (`/datasets`) - Manage training datasets
- **Training** (`/training`) - Configure and monitor training jobs
- **Models** (`/models`) - Download trained model artifacts  
- **Costs** (`/costs`) - View training cost analytics
- **Notifications** - Training status alerts

---

## Part 1: Migrating Existing Datasets

If you have existing training files from the conversation generation module, you can migrate them to the LoRA training datasets.

### Step 1: Navigate to Datasets Page

1. From dashboard, click **"LoRA Datasets"** button (or navigate to `/datasets`)

### Step 2: Import from Training File

**Option A: Using the Import API (Programmatic)**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/datasets/import-from-training-file" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -d '{
    "training_file_id": "existing-training-file-uuid",
    "dataset_name": "My Imported Dataset",
    "description": "Dataset imported from training files module"
  }'
```

**Option B: Using the UI (if Import button is available)**

1. On `/datasets` page, look for **"Import from Training File"** button
2. Select your existing training file
3. Enter dataset name and description
4. Click **"Import"**

### Step 3: Wait for Validation

- The dataset will automatically be copied from `training-files` bucket to `lora-datasets` bucket
- Validation runs automatically (check status every 1 minute)
- Status changes: `uploading` → `validating` → `ready`
- You'll receive a notification when validation completes

### Step 4: Verify Dataset is Ready

On the datasets page, you'll see:
- ✅ **Status:** `ready`
- ✅ **Training Ready:** `true`
- 📊 **Statistics:** Total training pairs, tokens, conversations

## Part 2: Uploading New Datasets

If you're uploading fresh training data (not from training files module):

### Step 1: Navigate to Upload Page

1. From `/datasets`, click **"Upload Dataset"** button
2. Or navigate directly to `/datasets/new`

### Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset

**Required Format:** BrightRun LoRA v4 (JSONL)

Each line must be valid JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "conversations": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Question or prompt"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Model response"
    }
  ]
}
```

**File Requirements:**
- Format: `.jsonl` (JSON Lines)
- Max size: 500 MB
- Each conversation must have at least 2 turns
- Recommended: 100+ training pairs for meaningful training

### Step 3: Upload Dataset

1. **Name:** Enter descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Support Q&A")
2. **Description:** Optional details about the dataset
3. **Format:** Select `brightrun_lora_v4`
4. **File:** Click "Choose File" and select your `.jsonl` file
5. Click **"Upload Dataset"**

### Step 4: Monitor Upload

- Progress bar shows upload status
- After upload completes, automatic validation begins
- Wait 1-2 minutes for validation
- Check notifications for completion alert

### Step 5: Review Validation Results

Visit `/datasets/[dataset-id]` to see:
- ✅ Validation status
- 📊 Dataset statistics (training pairs, tokens, avg turns per conversation)
- ⚠️ Validation errors (if any)
- 📋 Sample data preview

## Troubleshooting

### Dataset Upload Issues

**Problem:** Upload fails or gets stuck

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size (\u003c500MB limit)
2. Verify file format (must be `.jsonl`)
3. Validate JSON structure (each line must be valid JSON)
4. Check internet connection
5. Try uploading smaller batch first

### Dataset Validation Errors

**Problem:** Dataset status shows `error`

**Solutions:**
1. Click on dataset to view validation errors
2. Common issues:
   - Invalid JSON syntax
   - Missing required fields (`conversations`)
   - Empty conversations
   - Conversations with only 1 turn
   - Missing `role` or `content` fields
3. Fix errors in your source file
4. Re-upload corrected dataset

### Training Job Stuck in "Queued"

**Problem:** Job doesn't start training

**Solutions:**
1. Check if GPU cluster is available (may be at capacity)
2. Wait 5-10 minutes (jobs process every 30 seconds)
3. Check notifications for error messages
4. Verify dataset is `ready` status
5. Check Edge Function logs (admin only)

### Training Job Failed

**Problem:** Status shows `failed`

**Solutions:**
1. View error message on job details page
2. Common issues:
   - Dataset file inaccessible (re-upload dataset)
   - GPU out of memory (reduce batch size or use larger GPU)
   - Invalid hyperparameters (use preset instead of custom)
   - GPU cluster connection timeout (retry job)
3. If error persists, contact support with job ID

### Model Download Issues

**Problem:** Download links don't work

**Solutions:**
1. Check if links have expired (1 hour limit)
2. Request new download links
3. Ensure model status is `completed`
4. Check network/firewall settings
5. Try different browser

### High Training Costs

**Problem:** Costs are higher than expected

**Solutions:**
1. Review cost analytics (`/costs`) to identify expensive jobs
2. Use Conservative preset for testing
3. Start with smaller datasets to validate approach
4. Use A100 40GB instead of H100 for small/medium datasets
5. Cancel jobs early if loss isn't decreasing
6. Set up cost alerts (if available)
