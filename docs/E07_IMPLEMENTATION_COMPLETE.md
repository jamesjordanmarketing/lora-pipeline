- 📊 Active training jobs
- 💾 Storage buckets existence
- 📦 Recent dataset uploads
- 🎯 Recent model artifacts

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-lora-health.ts
```

**Output:** Quick visual summary of system health with color-coded status indicators

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Run Integration Verification Script**
   ```bash
   # Ensure .env.local is configured with all required variables
   npx tsx scripts/verify-lora-integration.ts
   ```
   
   **Expected:** All checks pass (green checkmarks), exit code 0

2. **Run Health Check Script**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/check-lora-health.ts
   ```
   
   **Expected:** Visual health status display with no red errors

3. **Review Documentation**
   - Read through `LORA_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Verify all steps are clear and actionable
   - Read through `LORA_MONITORING_SETUP.md`
   - Test a few SQL queries in Supabase Dashboard

4. **Test Monitoring Queries**
   
   In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   ```sql
   -- Check queue depth
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_jobs WHERE status = 'queued';
   
   -- Check recent datasets
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM datasets 
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
   
   -- Check storage usage
   SELECT 
     SUM(file_size) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 as total_gb
   FROM datasets
   WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
   ```
