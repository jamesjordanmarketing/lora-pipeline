Title
- FR6.4.1 Wireframes — Stage 6 — Model Quality Validation — Elena Morales Voice Consistency Scoring

Context Summary
- FR6.4.1 implements brand voice consistency evaluation by testing the trained model's adherence to Elena Morales's defined personality characteristics (warm, professional, clear, empathetic, empowering). The system generates 20 responses to scenarios designed to elicit voice characteristics, scores them across 5 personality dimensions using automated evaluation, and calculates an overall voice consistency score targeting ≥85% for strong brand alignment. This feature validates that LoRA training successfully instilled the desired brand personality without over-correction or voice drift, ensuring consistent client experience.

Journey Integration
- Stage 6 user goals: Validate brand personality acquisition, ensure voice consistency, demonstrate brand alignment for client confidence, celebrate personality achievement
- Key emotions: Pride when voice characteristics strongly match target, concern if voice drift detected, satisfaction with measurable personality, confidence in brand-aligned delivery
- Progressive disclosure levels: Basic users see overall voice consistency score and personality match; advanced users access dimension-by-dimension analysis and example responses; expert users review voice drift patterns and training data correlations
- Persona adaptations: Business Owners need brand proof for client presentations; Quality Analysts need consistency metrics and deviation identification; Brand Managers need personality alignment validation

### Journey-Informed Design Elements
- User Goals: Validate brand voice learned, quantify personality consistency, identify voice drift, demonstrate brand customization success
- Emotional Requirements: Pride in personality achievement, satisfaction with measurable brand alignment, relief when consistency high
- Progressive Disclosure:
  * Basic: Overall voice consistency score, personality match badge, key characteristics present/absent
  * Advanced: Dimension-by-dimension scoring, example responses showing voice, deviation analysis
  * Expert: Voice drift patterns, training data correlations, statistical confidence, cross-scenario consistency
- Success Indicators: ≥85% voice consistency (strong brand alignment), all 5 dimensions present, no significant drift, client-ready brand proof

Wireframe Goals
- Display overall voice consistency score prominently with brand alignment classification
- Show personality dimension breakdown (warm, professional, clear, empathetic, empowering) with individual scores
- Present example responses demonstrating Elena Morales voice characteristics
- Identify voice drift or missing characteristics with specific examples
- Provide recommendations for strengthening voice consistency
- Export brand voice validation reports for client proof

**Voice Characteristics Examples:**
- Section header: "Elena Morales Voice in Action (Top 5 Examples)"
- For each example:
  * Scenario: "Client asks: 'I feel overwhelmed by all these investment options. Where do I even start?'"
  * Response demonstrating voice: "'I hear you - investment options can feel really overwhelming at first, and that's completely normal [EMPATHY]. Let me break this down into three simple starting points that match where you are right now [CLARITY]. First, let's talk about your timeline...[continues with WARMTH, PROFESSIONALISM, EMPOWERMENT throughout]'"
  * Voice annotations: Highlighted phrases tagged with dimension labels [EMPATHY], [CLARITY], etc.
  * Consistency score: 4.7/5 (94%) - "Excellent voice consistency across all five dimensions"

**Voice Drift Analysis (if applicable):**
- Section header: "Voice Drift Detection"
- Conditional: Only shown if any dimension scores <70% or shows significant deviation
- For each drift:
  * Dimension affected: "Empowerment: 78% present (target 85%)"
  * Drift pattern: "Model sometimes provides solutions directly instead of guiding clients to discover their own answers"
  * Example quote showing drift: "'You should definitely open a Roth IRA and contribute $6,500 per year.'" (Directive, not empowering)
  * Recommended voice: "'Have you considered a Roth IRA? Based on what you've shared about your goals, it might be a great fit. Would you like to explore how it could work for your situation?'" (Empowering, invites collaboration)
