Title
- FR6.4.2 Wireframes — Stage 6 — Model Quality Validation — Client Brand Customization

Context Summary
- FR6.4.2 implements client-specific brand voice validation beyond the default Elena Morales personality, enabling evaluation of custom brand characteristics when clients provide their own voice profiles. The system tests the trained model's adherence to client-defined personality traits, communication style, and brand guidelines, calculates customization success scores, and provides brand alignment proof for client delivery. This feature supports diverse brand identities (from casual and friendly to formal and corporate) while maintaining the same rigorous validation methodology.

Journey Integration
- Stage 6 user goals: Validate custom brand personality achieved, demonstrate client-specific customization success, ensure brand consistency, generate client-ready brand proof
- Key emotions: Pride in successful customization, satisfaction with brand flexibility, confidence in client-specific delivery, excitement to demonstrate personalization
- Progressive disclosure levels: Basic users see overall brand alignment score and key characteristics; advanced users access custom trait analysis and example comparisons; expert users review brand consistency patterns and customization effectiveness
- Persona adaptations: Business Owners need brand proof for diverse clients; Brand Managers need validation that custom guidelines were followed; Quality Analysts need customization effectiveness metrics

### Journey-Informed Design Elements
- User Goals: Validate client brand learned, quantify custom personality consistency, demonstrate brand customization success, generate client-ready proof
- Emotional Requirements: Pride in customization achievement, satisfaction with brand flexibility, confidence in diverse brand handling
- Progressive Disclosure:
  * Basic: Overall brand alignment score, key custom traits present/absent, brand match badge
  * Advanced: Custom trait-by-trait analysis, example responses showing brand, deviation identification
  * Expert: Brand consistency across scenarios, customization effectiveness metrics, comparison with baseline generic voice
- Success Indicators: ≥85% custom brand alignment, all client-defined traits present, consistent brand experience, client-ready proof

Wireframe Goals
- Display overall custom brand alignment score prominently
- Show client-defined trait breakdown with individual presence scores
- Present example responses demonstrating client's specific brand voice
- Identify brand deviations or missing traits with specific examples
- Provide recommendations for strengthening custom brand consistency
- Export customized brand validation reports for client delivery

Explicit UI Requirements (from acceptance criteria)

**Custom Brand Card Header:**
- Card header: "Custom Brand Voice: [Client Brand Name]"
- Subtitle: "Client-Defined Characteristics: [Trait 1] | [Trait 2] | [Trait 3] | [Trait 4] | [Trait 5]"
  * Example: "Casual | Friendly | Data-Driven | Transparent | Action-Oriented"
- Alignment badge: "✓ Strong Brand Match" (≥85%, green), "⚠ Moderate Match" (70-84%, yellow), "✗ Weak Match" (<70%, red)

**Overall Brand Alignment Score:**
- Large prominent display: "91% Brand Alignment Score"
- Comparison: Target: 85%, Your model: 91%, Status: "Exceeds client brand standards"
- Interpretation: "Model consistently demonstrates [Client]'s casual, friendly, data-driven, transparent, and action-oriented voice across diverse scenarios."
- Visual: Circular progress indicator showing 91% with client logo/brand icon

**Client-Defined Trait Breakdown (5-7 cards, variable based on client profile):**
- Example for "Tech Startup Brand" with traits: Casual, Data-Driven, Transparent, Innovative, Action-Oriented

- **Casual Trait**:
  * Score: "4.4/5 = 88% present"
  * Indicators: "Uses conversational language, avoids stuffiness, relatable tone"
  * Example quote: "'Hey there! Great question. Let me break down compound interest in a way that actually makes sense...'"
  * Status: ✓ Strong (green)

- **Data-Driven Trait**:
  * Score: "4.6/5 = 92% present"
  * Indicators: "Cites statistics, uses concrete numbers, backs claims with research"
  * Example quote: "'According to Vanguard's 2023 analysis of 1.2 million retirement accounts, investors who maintained consistent contributions through market downturns achieved 34% higher returns over 20-year periods.'"
  * Status: ✓ Strong (green)

- **Transparent Trait**:
  * Score: "4.3/5 = 86% present"
  * Indicators: "Acknowledges limitations, admits unknowns, explains reasoning clearly"
  * Example quote: "'I'll be honest - predicting short-term market movements is basically impossible. What we can do is...'"
  * Status: ✓ Strong (green)

- **Innovative Trait**:
  * Score: "4.1/5 = 82% present"
  * Indicators: "Suggests creative approaches, embraces new methods, challenges status quo"
  * Example quote: "'Instead of the traditional 60/40 portfolio, have you considered a risk parity approach that dynamically adjusts based on volatility signals?'"
  * Status: ✓ Strong (green)

- **Action-Oriented Trait**:
  * Score: "4.7/5 = 94% present"
  * Indicators: "Provides concrete next steps, clear calls-to-action, emphasizes implementation"
  * Example quote: "'Here's what I recommend you do this week: 1) Open a Roth IRA account, 2) Set up automatic $500 monthly contributions, 3) Choose a target date fund matching your retirement year. I can walk you through each step.'"
  * Status: ✓ Strong (green)

- Radar chart visualization: 5-7 axis radar showing all client-defined traits with target line at 85%

**Brand Voice Comparison (Generic vs Custom):**
- Side-by-side comparison showing default Elena Morales voice vs client custom brand
- Example:
  * Scenario: "Client asks about diversification benefits"
  * Elena Morales (warm, professional, empathetic): "'I understand your concern about putting all your eggs in one basket - that's actually a very wise instinct to have...'"
  * [Client] Brand (casual, data-driven, action-oriented): "'Good question! Data shows diversification reduces portfolio volatility by 40-60% on average. Here's how to diversify your portfolio in 3 steps...'"
  * Customization success: "Model successfully adapted from warm/empathetic tone to casual/data-driven tone while maintaining quality"

**Custom Brand Examples:**
- Section header: "[Client] Brand Voice in Action (Top 5 Examples)"
- For each example:
  * Scenario: "Client confused about tax implications"
  * Response demonstrating custom brand: "'Let's cut through the tax jargon [CASUAL]. Here's the data: Roth IRA contributions are post-tax, meaning you pay taxes now at your current rate (let's say 24%) [DATA-DRIVEN]. Why does this matter? If tax rates increase to 30% by retirement, you just saved 6% on potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars [TRANSPARENT MATH]. Bottom line: Open a Roth IRA before April 15 to maximize this year's contribution [ACTION-ORIENTED].'"
  * Brand annotations: Highlighted phrases tagged with client trait labels [CASUAL], [DATA-DRIVEN], etc.
  * Alignment score: 4.8/5 (96%) - "Excellent brand alignment across all client-defined traits"

**Brand Deviation Analysis (if applicable):**
- Section header: "Brand Deviations Detected"
- Conditional: Only shown if any trait scores <70% or shows significant drift
- For each deviation:
  * Trait affected: "Casual: 82% present (target 85%)"
  * Deviation pattern: "Model occasionally uses formal financial terminology instead of conversational language"
  * Example showing deviation: "'It is advisable to consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to optimize after-tax returns.'" (Too formal for casual brand)
  * Recommended brand voice: "'Here's a smart tax move: sell losing investments to offset your gains (called tax-loss harvesting). Can save you thousands in taxes.'" (Casual, clear, action-oriented)
  * Recommendation: "Add 5+ training conversations explicitly modeling casual, conversational tone"

**Brand Customization Effectiveness:**
- Metrics card comparing generic baseline vs custom-trained model:
  * Brand trait alignment: Generic (45%), Custom-trained (91%), Improvement: +46pp
  * Client characteristic presence: Generic (2 of 5 traits), Custom-trained (5 of 5 traits), Improvement: 100% trait coverage
  * Brand consistency: Generic (varying voice), Custom-trained (consistent), Status: Achieved
- Interpretation: "Training successfully customized model to client brand, significantly outperforming generic personality"

**Client Brand Proof Statement:**
- Client-ready proof section:
  * "This model has been customized and validated to consistently demonstrate [Client]'s unique brand voice across 20 diverse scenarios."
  * "Brand alignment score: 91% (exceeds 85% target)"
  * "All five client-defined characteristics present at strong levels (82-94%)"
  * "Validated for client deployment with consistent [Client]-specific brand experience"
  * "Customization represents +46 percentage point improvement over generic baseline"

**Multiple Brand Profiles Support (if applicable):**
- For clients with multiple brand profiles (e.g., B2C vs B2B, different product lines):
  * Brand profile selector: "Evaluate against: [Profile A: Consumer Brand] [Profile B: Enterprise Brand]"
  * Separate alignment scores per profile
  * Profile-specific trait breakdowns
  * Cross-profile consistency analysis: "Model successfully differentiates between consumer (casual, friendly) and enterprise (professional, data-driven) contexts"

**Export Custom Brand Report:**
- "Export Brand Report" button
- PDF report includes:
  * Client branding (logo, colors, fonts)
  * Executive summary: Overall alignment score, trait breakdown, customization success
  * Client-defined trait analysis with scores and indicators
  * Top 5 brand examples with annotations
