Ok I see the results here:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\_run-prompts\04d-infrastructure-inventory_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\_run-prompts\04d-implementation-guide_v1.md`
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\_run-prompts\04d-extension-strategy_v1.md`

Another agent executed an analysis of the following:

1. Are these three documents meant to **REPLACE** the structured non-integrated specification here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\04c-pipeline-structured-from-wireframe_v1.md` 

or do they need to be used in conjunction?

2. My goal is to produce a set of prompts that will build each section in a progressive way. Meaning progressive within the section **AND** progressive between sections as well.

I currently have an example of how I want this to work operationally.
This script:
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_tools\04d-generate-FR-wireframe-segments_v1-deprecated.js` does something similar in that it:
1. Splits the structured spec into multiple specs and prompt files.
2. Produces both a specification file for each section
3. Produces multiple execution prompts that use the specification file to build the section in a high quality way.

Read that script and the prompts that it uses to understand how it operates.
Here is an example of the execution prompt:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\fr-maps\archive\train\04-FR-wireframes-execution-E01.md`

What would be the best way to create a meta prompt that segments a structured specification into multiple sections and specs that work progressively to build the application? 

I guess if this spec: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\_run-prompts\04d-implementation-guide_v1.md` is complete **AND** structured in the right way, it could be adapted as the input to a new .js

but if we need each section prompt to correctly apply the knowledge in all four files:
then we either need a prompt that takes those files into account (they will need to read the entire integration files for each section analysis in order to create the sectional prompt files)  **OR** we need to create  another meta prompt that will be personalized to integrate all the integration specs and the core structured spec into one final integrated and structured spec that has all integration and build operations sectionalized.

How do you recommend we go about this? My goal is that we can execute the module build by simply executing each prompt in turn (within sections and between sections)
