## 📖 Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Base Meta-Prompt Template

The complete meta-prompt methodology is defined in:
`pmc/product/_prompt_engineering/04f-integrated-spec-to-progressive-prompts_v2.md`

**Key sections to reference:**
- Phase 1: Section Analysis (how to parse features)
- Phase 2: Prompt Planning (how to group features)
- Phase 3: Prompt Generation (the prompt template)
- Phase 4: Cross-Prompt Validation (quality checks)

### Step 2: Read the Section File

Load and analyze the complete section specification:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\full-build\04f-pipeline-build-section-E05.md`

**What to extract:**
- All features (FR-5.X format)
- Code blocks (SQL, TypeScript, TSX, etc.)
- File specifications (paths, new vs modify)
- Dependencies (on previous sections and within section)
- Acceptance criteria

### Step 3: Apply the Meta-Prompt Phases

Follow the methodology from the base meta-prompt:

#### Phase 1: Section Analysis
- Parse section metadata (already done above)
- Extract all 2 features
- Assess complexity for each feature
- Build dependency graph

#### Phase 2: Prompt Planning
- Determine grouping strategy (Layer-Based, Feature-Based, or Single Prompt)
- Group features into logical prompts (target 6-8 hours each)
- Define integration points between prompts
- Ensure correct dependency order

#### Phase 3: Prompt Generation
- Use the prompt template from base meta-prompt
- Generate one prompt for each group
- Include all code blocks from section file
- Specify integration points with previous sections: E01, E02, E03, E04
- Add acceptance criteria and testing steps

#### Phase 4: Cross-Prompt Validation
- Verify all features covered
- Check dependencies are correct
- Ensure no redundancy
- Validate integration points

### Step 4: Generate Output File

Create a single markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
