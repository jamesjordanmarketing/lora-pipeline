# LoRA Training Pipeline: RunPod Architecture + Implementation Request

**Status:** Draft request/specification (to be actioned by an agent)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-27  
**Primary Goal:** Establish the correct architecture and operating model for private LoRA fine-tuning workflows (with RunPod), and produce two implementation documents at specific full file paths.

---

## 1) Current Context and Original Requirements

I have been building the LoRA training pipeline. My original requirements are:

1. Setting up a private open weight LLM (probably **Qwen 3-Next-80B-A3B**) so my client can have a private AI server
2. The client wants to train their private LLM using **LoRA** (which I am building)
3. Currently we are building the pipeline from my **Vercel** server to send **LoRA training sets** to a LoRA training instance
4. I am using **Runpod.io** for my private LLM

---

## 2) Primary Architecture Question (Immediate Confusion)

Can I use a **serverless LLM** for this project or do I need a **private Pod** which I setup myself?

I am a bit confused as to the exact way in which my **Vercel hosted pipeline** will do the training. My current spec is telling me that it does the training and then I download the LoRA trained file and put in my LLM...or an API transmission that does the same thing.

---

## 3) Questions That Must Be Resolved (Do Not Skip Any)

So I need to know:

1. Can I use a serverless LLM for this project or do I need a private Pod which I setup myself?
2. I thought we had to train the EXACT alive LLM with our dataset and then it was done. Is this true?
3. What is the **best architecture** for this project that lets me train a Qwen 3-Next-80B-A3B model using my own private datasets
4. To be fair I would also like to be able to train many different models for testing, and even possibly train a frontier model (on AWS? I am not sure how to do this). I do want the largest functionality. You can see an overview of this pipeline in the attached file and the current implementation details we are currently deploying:
5. Is there anything else I should know about the best way to do this?
6. The immediate request is for me to supply the:

   - `GPU_CLUSTER_API_URL`: Your GPU cluster provider's API endpoint  
   - `GPU_CLUSTER_API_KEY`: Your GPU cluster API authentication key  

   Given the preferences I stated above, how do I get these?

7. Cost:

   Runpod says a serverless h100 80gb costs:

   **80GB H100 PRO**  
   costs:  
   - $0.00116/s FLEX  
   - $0.00093/s ACTIVE  

   or **$3.35/hour**

   Whereas a RunPod pod is:  
   **H100 PCIe 80 GB VRAM 188 GB RAM 16 vCPUs**  
   **$1.99/hr**  
   and a **A100** is only **$1.19 per hour**

   both of these are significantly less. Is there something I am missing? Does serverless only charge when it is processing? Still seems like it would be processing continually a LoRA data set for several hours (same as in a Pod). If I use serverless do I need a FLEX?

   At this stage of development I can be certain to end a Pod spin up immediately after it is done (i.e. it wont sit idle and cost me money)

8. What domain of knowledge creates the `train_lora.py` and docker image?

## 4) Output Requirements for the Agent (Formatting + Research Requirements)

Please provide detailed, accurate, precise, and functional answers to these questions. Write the answers to a **formal markdown format** that I can paste in a Google doc.

Make sure to browse the **CURRENT** web for answers to these questions (as well as your original response).

Return the analysis and solutions in compliant markdown that I can copy.

---

## 5) Additional Questions / Feasibility Checks

9. Is it even possible to connect to a private Pod via API?

## 6) Conflicting Guidance Received (Must Be Reconciled Using Current Web Evidence)

10. One agent told me:

   > "Pluggable backends:
   >
   > For models that are HF-native → transformers + peft.
   >
   > For Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B specifically, official docs mention full SFT but not PEFT/LoRA support yet; 30B and 8B variants have LoRA recipes through NVIDIA Megatron Bridge."

Now I am very concerned. I was told previously that LoRA was practically ubiquitous in training and would train all the best models (open and closed). But is this agent saying Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B cannot be trained by LoRA and that instead it needs something different.

I asked yet another (3rd) agent and got this response:

> `Yes, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B (and its smaller variants like 8B) can absolutely be fine-tuned with LoRA, even though it's a large MoE model, with community success reported using standard PEFT/LoRA techniques for efficiency, especially on consumer GPUs for smaller versions or large setups for 80B, requiring techniques like gradient checkpointing, QLoRA, and distributed training for larger scales. The key is efficient implementation (PEFT/LoRA) rather than full fine-tuning, leveraging its sparse MoE nature for faster training and inference, though careful rank selection (like Rank 8 for reasoning tasks) is crucial to avoid breaking core functions.
> How to Train with LoRA/PEFT:
> Use PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) Libraries: Integrate LoRA adapters using Hugging Face's PEFT library with SFTTrainer or optimized versions like NeuronSFTTrainer for specific hardware.
> Apply QLoRA/4-bit: For consumer GPUs, use 4-bit quantization (QLoRA) to fit the model, allowing fine-tuning on 16-24GB VRAM for smaller variants.
> Consider Distributed Training: For the full 80B model or larger batch sizes, use techniques like Data Parallelism (DDP) and Tensor Parallelism, often with frameworks like optimum-neuron/training_tutorials/finetune_qwen3.
> Choose the Right Rank (LoRA Dimension): Lower ranks (e.g., 8) are better for preserving reasoning/instruction following, while higher ranks risk overfitting and degrading performance.
> Gradient Checkpointing: Essential for reducing memory usage during training.
> What It Needs (Hardware/Software):
> Software: PEFT & transformers (Hugging Face), optimum-neuron (for AWS Trainium).
> Hardware: Consumer GPUs (16-24GB VRAM for QLoRA 4B/8B) or multiple high-end GPUs (like 8x H200 for large contexts/80B).
> Why LoRA Works Well:
> Efficiency: Activates only a small fraction of parameters (LoRA adapters) rather than the full model, saving significant VRAM and time.
> Preserves Base Capabilities: Low-rank LoRA fine-tuning helps maintain the model's strong base instruction following and reasoning, unlike full fine-tuning which can cause catastrophic forgetting.`

I really need to boil this down so a non machine learning engineer can understand this. Look at my current codebase and tell me what it is capable of doing, and how we should train a Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B model.

## 7) External Documents to Review (Authoritative Inputs)

In addition to this I have been given conflicting information by several models.

Read this one:
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\Gemini-LoRA-Training-Infrastructure-Architecture-Guide.md`

The Gemini one was generated by **Gemini 3.0** without asking it to search the current web. I forgot to require that.

Read this one:
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\Perplexity-LoRA-Training-Infrastructure-Architecture-Guide.md`

This Perplexity one was generated by the **Perplexity auto assigned model**...and I DID remember to ask it to search the web.

---

## 8) Codebase and Integrated Specification to Internalize

In addition I need you to read and internalize our **CURRENT** codebase here:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\src`

and the full integrated spec here:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\04e-pipeline-integrated-extension-spec_v1.md`

so you understand our current application framework.

---

## 9) Freshness and Accuracy Requirements (Time-Bound)

Make sure you use the most **CURRENT** and accurate information by accessing the web as of **12/27/25** and doing a thorough analysis of the best solution for my use case as of **NOW** (not the best solution from months ago).

Resolve these issues and handle all conflictual information using the most recent information on the web.

---

## 10) Required Deliverables (Two Separate Documents + Full Output Scope)

I want you to supply your detailed analysis and solutions in two documents:

### Deliverable 1: Detailed Analysis + Recommendation (Non-ML-Engineer Readable)

Write to the document:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\full-build\04f-pipeline-build-section-E04.5-runpod-analysis.md`

This must contain a full detailed analysis and careful consideration of our best path forward. Answer all the questions and provide an accurate, precise, and comprehensive solution.

**Audience requirement:** Write this in terms that a non ML engineer can understand. Write it like you are explaining it to an early career software programmer.

### Deliverable 2: Implementation Specification (RunPod Ops + Autonomous Engineer Prompt)

Write to the document:

- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\lora-pipeline\pmc\product\_mapping\pipeline\full-build\04f-pipeline-build-section-E04.5-runpod-instructions.md`

This must be a full spec for implementing your recommended solution. Break it into sections that:

- **Section 1:** Me (the human engineer) must execute by logging into RunPod and building all the correct configurations. I don't need a lot of background about WHY I am doing each step. I just need concise and granular step by step instruction.
- **Section 2:** The coding engineer agent can execute autonomously via a detailed, accurate, and precise prompt.
