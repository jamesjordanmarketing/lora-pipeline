## Build Overview

### Specification Summary

The BrightRun LoRA Training Platform is a comprehensive full-stack application that enables AI engineers to transform conversation datasets into trained LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models for fine-tuning large language models. The platform manages the entire pipeline from dataset upload and validation through GPU-based training job execution to final model artifact delivery.

This specification details the complete conversion of an existing Vite-based wireframe (5 complete pages: Dashboard, Datasets Manager, Training Configurator, Training Monitor, and Model Artifacts) into a production-ready Next.js 14 application with App Router. The wireframe contains fully-designed UI components using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, which will be preserved during migration.

The backend implementation adds PostgreSQL database persistence, NextAuth.js authentication, RESTful API routes, Server-Sent Events for real-time progress streaming, S3-compatible object storage for datasets and models, BullMQ job queue orchestration, and integration with an external GPU training cluster API.

**Key Technical Components:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes + PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **Real-Time:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for training progress streaming
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Supabase Storage)
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5 with credentials provider
- **Job Queue:** BullMQ + Redis for training job orchestration
- **External Integration:** GPU cluster API for LoRA training execution

**User Journey:**
1. Upload/Import Dataset → 2. Validate & Preview → 3. Configure Training Job → 4. Launch Training → 5. Monitor Real-Time Progress → 6. View/Download Model Artifacts

### Build Strategy

**Selected Approach:** Layer-Based Architecture with Progressive Integration

This strategy was chosen because:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The specification naturally divides into infrastructure layer (database, auth, storage), API layer (backend routes), presentation layer (frontend pages), and integration layer (real-time features, external services).

2. **Foundation-First Approach:** Database schema and authentication must be established before any meaningful feature implementation can occur. Building the foundation first enables all subsequent prompts to leverage stable, tested infrastructure.

3. **Parallel Development Potential:** Once the foundation is established (Prompt 1), frontend and backend work can proceed somewhat independently, with clear integration points defined upfront.

4. **Wireframe Preservation:** The existing wireframe's component structure is well-designed and doesn't need refactoring—it needs *integration* with backend services. This makes a layer-based approach ideal, as we can migrate the entire frontend as a cohesive unit rather than feature-by-feature.

5. **Risk Mitigation:** Complex integrations (external GPU cluster, real-time SSE streaming) are isolated in dedicated prompts (4, 6) after core functionality is stable, reducing the risk of cascading failures.

6. **Alignment with Specification:** The specification itself is organized by technical layer (Database Schema, API Specification, Frontend Migration, etc.), making this approach natural and traceable.

### Prompt Sequence Logic

```
Prompt 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
    ↓
Prompt 2: Backend Core APIs (Datasets & Jobs)
    ↓
Prompt 3: Frontend Migration (All 5 Pages)
    ↓ (Prompts 2 & 3 integrate here)
Prompt 4: Real-Time Features & Job Orchestration
    ↓
Prompt 5: Models & Artifacts Management
    ↓
Prompt 6: Cost Tracking & Notifications
    ↓
Prompt 7: Testing, Polish & Deployment
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Prompt 1** establishes all infrastructure dependencies: database schema, authentication system, S3 client, Redis connection, and base utilities. Every subsequent prompt depends on these foundations.

- **Prompt 2** implements the two most critical API groups (Datasets and Jobs) that represent the core business logic. These APIs are extensively specified in the document and require careful implementation of validation, error handling, and business rules.

- **Prompt 3** migrates the entire frontend from Vite to Next.js, converting all 5 wireframe pages to App Router structure. By this point, the APIs from Prompt 2 exist, enabling immediate integration and testing of the full user flow (minus real-time features).

- **Prompt 4** adds the complex real-time layer: Server-Sent Events for progress streaming, BullMQ worker process, and external GPU cluster integration. This is isolated because it's high-risk and benefits from having stable APIs and UI to integrate with.

- **Prompt 5** completes the CRUD operations by implementing the Models/Artifacts API and management features. This depends on job completion (Prompt 4) and provides download/deployment capabilities.

- **Prompt 6** adds auxiliary features that enhance the core experience: real-time cost tracking, budget alerts, and notification system. These are important but non-blocking for core functionality.

- **Prompt 7** focuses on quality, stability, and production-readiness: comprehensive testing, error handling improvements, performance optimization, and deployment configuration.

### Risk Mitigation

**High-Risk Areas and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **External GPU Cluster Integration (Prompt 4)**
   - **Risk:** Vendor-specific API may be unavailable or poorly documented
   - **Mitigation:** Prompt 4 includes detailed mock implementation and clear interface abstraction. If real API unavailable, stub implementation enables full system testing.
   - **Fallback:** Implement simulator that mimics training progress for demo purposes

2. **Real-Time SSE Streaming Reliability (Prompt 4)**
   - **Risk:** SSE connections may drop, especially behind load balancers or proxies
   - **Mitigation:** Implement automatic reconnection logic, exponential backoff, and fallback to polling if SSE fails
   - **Validation:** Explicit testing steps included in Prompt 4 for connection stability

3. **Large File Upload Performance (Prompt 2)**
   - **Risk:** Dataset files >1GB may timeout or fail during upload
   - **Mitigation:** Use presigned S3 URLs for direct browser-to-S3 upload, bypassing Next.js API route limits
   - **Validation:** Prompt 2 includes testing with large file sizes

4. **Database Performance at Scale (Prompt 1)**
   - **Risk:** Poor indexing could cause slow queries as data grows
   - **Mitigation:** Prompt 1 includes comprehensive index strategy from specification, with explicit indexes for all query patterns
   - **Validation:** Prompt 7 includes query performance testing

5. **Cost Calculation Accuracy (Prompt 6)**
   - **Risk:** Real-time cost tracking could drift from actual costs
   - **Mitigation:** Implement reconciliation service and audit logs, use Decimal type for currency to avoid floating-point errors
   - **Validation:** Cost calculation formulas explicitly defined and testable

## 🗄️ Database Requirements

### Schema Implementation

Create `prisma/schema.prisma` with the complete database schema as specified in the iteration-8 document (lines 1450-1865).

**Key Models to Implement:**

1. **User** - Authentication and profile
2. **Dataset** - Uploaded conversation datasets
3. **TrainingJob** - Training job configuration and status
4. **MetricsPoint** - Time-series training metrics
5. **Checkpoint** - Model checkpoints during training
6. **JobLog** - Training job logs
7. **ModelArtifact** - Trained model artifacts
8. **CostRecord** - Cost tracking records
9. **Notification** - User notifications

**Enums to Define:**

- `UserRole` (USER, ADMIN, BILLING_ADMIN)
- `SubscriptionTier` (FREE, STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE)
- `DatasetFormat` (BRIGHTRUN_LORA_V4, BRIGHTRUN_LORA_V3)
- `DatasetStatus` (UPLOADING, VALIDATING, READY, ERROR)
- `JobStatus` (QUEUED, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
- `JobStage` (QUEUED, INITIALIZING, TRAINING, VALIDATING, SAVING, COMPLETED)
- `LogLevel` (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `ModelStatus` (STORED, DEPLOYED, ARCHIVED)
- `CostType` (COMPUTE, STORAGE, DATA_TRANSFER, API_CALLS)
- `NotificationType` (JOB_COMPLETE, JOB_FAILED, COST_ALERT, SYSTEM, DATASET_READY)
- `NotificationPriority` (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)

**Critical Relationships:**

```prisma
// User owns many datasets, jobs, models
User ┬→ Dataset (one-to-many)
     ├→ TrainingJob (one-to-many)
     ├→ ModelArtifact (one-to-many)
     ├→ CostRecord (one-to-many)
     └→ Notification (one-to-many)

// Dataset used in many training jobs
Dataset → TrainingJob (one-to-many)

// Training job has many metrics, checkpoints, logs
TrainingJob ┬→ MetricsPoint (one-to-many)
            ├→ Checkpoint (one-to-many)
            ├→ JobLog (one-to-many)
            ├→ CostRecord (one-to-many)
            └→ ModelArtifact (one-to-one)

// Model artifact references parent/child versions
ModelArtifact → ModelArtifact (self-referential tree)
```

**Indexes (Performance Critical):**

```sql
-- Specification lines 1868-1899 define these indexes:

User:
  - email (unique)

Dataset:
  - (userId, status)
  - (userId, createdAt DESC)

TrainingJob:
  - (userId, status)
  - (status, queuedAt)
  - externalJobId (unique)

MetricsPoint:
  - (jobId, timestamp)
  - (jobId, step)

JobLog:
  - (jobId, timestamp)

ModelArtifact:
  - (userId, status)
  - (userId, createdAt DESC)

CostRecord:
  - (userId, billingPeriod)
  - jobId

Notification:
  - (userId, read, createdAt DESC)
```

### Data Access Setup

```typescript
// lib/db.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

// PrismaClient singleton pattern (prevents connection pool exhaustion in development)
const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

export const prisma =
  globalForPrisma.prisma ||
  new PrismaClient({
    log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error'],
  });

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;

// Database transaction helper
export async function transaction<T>(
  callback: (tx: PrismaClient) => Promise<T>
): Promise<T> {
  return prisma.$transaction(callback);
}

// Health check
export async function checkDatabaseHealth(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Database health check failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Migration & Seed

```bash
# Initialize Prisma
npx prisma init

# Create initial migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate
```

```typescript
// prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  // Create test user
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash('password123', 10);
  
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'demo@brightrun.ai',
      passwordHash,
      name: 'Demo User',
      organization: 'BrightRun Demo',
      role: 'USER',
      subscriptionTier: 'PROFESSIONAL',
      monthlyBudget: 500.00,
    },
  });

  console.log('Created demo user:', user.email);

  // Create sample dataset
  const dataset = await prisma.dataset.create({
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      name: 'Sample Conversation Dataset',
      description: 'Demo dataset for testing',
      format: 'BRIGHTRUN_LORA_V4',
      status: 'READY',
      trainingReady: true,
      s3Bucket: 'brightrun-demo',
      s3Key: 'datasets/sample/dataset.jsonl',
      fileSize: BigInt(1024000),
      fileName: 'sample-dataset.jsonl',
      totalTrainingPairs: 1000,
      totalValidationPairs: 200,
      totalTokens: BigInt(500000),
      avgTurnsPerConversation: 8.5,
      avgTokensPerTurn: 58.8,
      validatedAt: new Date(),
    },
  });

  console.log('Created sample dataset:', dataset.id);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

    return apiError('INTERNAL_ERROR', 'Failed to create account', 500);
  }
}
```

#### NextAuth Configuration

```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@auth/prisma-adapter';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  session: { strategy: 'jwt' },
  pages: {
    signIn: '/login',
  },
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: 'credentials',
      credentials: {
        email: { label: 'Email', type: 'email' },
        password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password' },
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) {
          return null;
        }

        const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
          where: { email: credentials.email as string },
        });

        if (!user || !user.passwordHash) {
          return null;
        }

        const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(
          credentials.password as string,
          user.passwordHash
        );

        if (!isValid) {
          return null;
        }

        return {
          id: user.id,
          email: user.email,
          name: user.name,
          role: user.role,
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, user }) {
      if (user) {
        token.id = user.id;
        token.role = user.role;
      }
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      if (token && session.user) {
        session.user.id = token.id as string;
        session.user.role = token.role as string;
      }
      return session;
    },
  },
});

// API route handler
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
export { handlers as GET, handlers as POST } from '@/lib/auth';
```

### Route Protection

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default auth((req) => {
  const isAuthenticated = !!req.auth;
  const isAuthPage = 
    req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login') ||
    req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/signup');
  const isApiRoute = req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api');

  // Protect all routes except auth pages and public API routes
  if (!isAuthenticated && !isAuthPage && !isApiRoute) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  // Redirect authenticated users away from auth pages
  if (isAuthenticated && isAuthPage) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!api/auth|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

```typescript
// lib/api-auth.ts
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { apiError } from './api-response';

export async function requireAuth() {
  const session = await auth();
  
  if (!session?.user) {
    return {
      error: apiError('UNAUTHORIZED', 'Authentication required', 401),
      user: null,
    };
  }
  
  return { user: session.user, error: null };
}

// Usage in API routes:
// const { user, error } = await requireAuth();
// if (error) return error;
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Set up environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with real credentials
   
   # Run Prisma migrations
   npx prisma migrate dev
   
   # Seed database
   npx prisma db seed
   
   # Verify in Prisma Studio
   npx prisma studio
   ```
   - Expected: Database created, all tables visible in Prisma Studio
   - Verify: Demo user exists with email `demo@brightrun.ai`
   - Verify: Sample dataset exists and is linked to demo user

2. **Authentication Flow:**
   ```bash
   # Start dev server
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   **Test Signup:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password123",
       "name": "Test User"
     }'
   ```
   - Expected: `{"success": true, "data": {"user": {...}}}`
   - Verify: User appears in database with hashed password
   
   **Test Login:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login` (page doesn't exist yet, expect 404)
   - Note: Full login UI in Prompt 3, but NextAuth API route should be accessible

3. **S3 Client:**
   ```typescript
   // Test in Node.js console or API route
   import { storage } from '@/lib/storage';
   
   const uploadUrl = await storage.generateUploadUrl('test/file.txt');
   console.log('Upload URL:', uploadUrl);
   // Expected: Valid S3 presigned URL string
   
   const downloadUrl = await storage.generateDownloadUrl('test/file.txt');
   console.log('Download URL:', downloadUrl);
   // Expected: Valid S3 presigned URL string
   ```

4. **Redis Connection:**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis connection
   node -e "import { redis, checkRedisHealth } from './lib/redis.ts'; await checkRedisHealth();"
   ```
   - Expected: `true` (connection successful)
   - Verify: No error logs in console

### Error Cases to Test

- [ ] Signup with existing email returns `USER_EXISTS` error
- [ ] Signup with invalid email format returns `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- [ ] Signup with password < 8 characters returns `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- [ ] Login with wrong password returns null (NextAuth behavior)
- [ ] Database connection failure logs error and throws
- [ ] Redis connection failure logs error and retries
- [ ] S3 client with invalid credentials throws error

### Validation Queries

```sql
-- Verify all tables created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Expected tables:
-- Checkpoint, CostRecord, Dataset, JobLog, MetricsPoint, 
-- ModelArtifact, Notification, TrainingJob, User

-- Verify indexes
SELECT tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Verify demo user
SELECT id, email, name, role, "subscriptionTier" 
FROM "User" 
WHERE email = 'demo@brightrun.ai';

-- Verify sample dataset
SELECT id, name, status, "trainingReady", "totalTrainingPairs"
FROM "Dataset"
WHERE name = 'Sample Conversation Dataset';
```

## 🔜 Next Steps (For Next Prompt)

This prompt's deliverables will be used by **Prompt 2: Backend Core APIs** for:

- **`lib/db.ts`** - Prisma client for all database operations
- **`lib/api-auth.ts`** - `requireAuth()` helper for protecting API routes
- **`lib/storage.ts`** - S3 client for dataset upload and model download
- **`lib/api-response.ts`** - `apiSuccess()` and `apiError()` for consistent responses
- **`types/*`** - Type definitions for API request/response validation
- **Prisma schema** - Complete database structure for CRUD operations
- **NextAuth session** - User authentication state for resource ownership checks

**What's Coming Next (Prompt 2):**

Prompt 2 will implement the two most critical API groups:

1. **Datasets API** - Complete CRUD operations, upload flow with presigned URLs, validation pipeline, and dataset statistics
2. **Jobs API (Basic)** - Job creation, configuration, cost estimation, and basic status queries (real-time streaming deferred to Prompt 4)

These APIs will enable the frontend (Prompt 3) to have real data to display and interact with, making the application functional for the core user journey: upload dataset → configure training → launch job.

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Code Style & Patterns

**File Organization:**
- API routes in `app/api/[resource]/route.ts`
- Shared libraries in `lib/[purpose].ts`
- Type definitions in `types/[entity].ts`
- One export per utility file (clear imports)

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```typescript
try {
  // Operation
  return apiSuccess(data);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
    return apiError('VALIDATION_ERROR', 'Invalid data', 400, error.errors);
  }
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  return apiError('INTERNAL_ERROR', 'Operation failed', 500);
}
```

**Database Query Pattern:**
```typescript
const resource = await prisma.resource.findUnique({
  where: { id, userId }, // Always filter by ownership
  select: { /* Only needed fields */ },
});

if (!resource) {
  return apiError('NOT_FOUND', 'Resource not found', 404);
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Database Connection Pooling:** Use the Prisma Client singleton pattern (`lib/db.ts`) to prevent connection pool exhaustion in development hot reload
2. **Password Security:** Always hash passwords with bcrypt before storing; never log or expose password hashes
3. **Environment Variables:** Never commit `.env.local` to git; use `.env.example` as template
4. **Type Safety:** Leverage Prisma's generated types; avoid `any` types except in error handling
5. **Error Logging:** Always `console.error()` caught exceptions with context before returning generic error messages
6. **S3 Presigned URLs:** URLs expire after 1 hour by default; document this in client-facing code
7. **Redis Connection:** Configure reconnection strategy to handle Redis restarts gracefully
8. **Prisma Schema Changes:** Always run `npx prisma generate` after modifying `schema.prisma`
9. **NextAuth Session:** JWT strategy chosen for scalability; tokens include minimal data (id, role)
10. **Decimal Types:** Use Prisma's `Decimal` type for currency to avoid floating-point precision errors

---

## 🎓 Success Indicators

You'll know this prompt is complete when:

1. ✅ `npm run dev` starts without errors
2. ✅ `npx prisma studio` shows all 9 tables with correct schemas
3. ✅ Database seed script runs and creates demo user + sample dataset
4. ✅ Signup API endpoint creates user and returns success response
5. ✅ Login with demo credentials via NextAuth succeeds
6. ✅ Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
7. ✅ S3 client generates valid presigned URLs (testable with curl)
8. ✅ Redis client connects and responds to ping command
9. ✅ All TypeScript files compile without errors (`npm run build`)
10. ✅ No ESLint warnings for unused variables or imports
11. ✅ All type definitions export correctly and can be imported
12. ✅ Database indexes are created (verify with Prisma Studio or psql)

**Validation Command:**
```bash
# Run all checks
npm run build && npx prisma validate && npm run lint
```

If all checks pass, Prompt 1 is complete! 🎉
