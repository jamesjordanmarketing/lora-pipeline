## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 1 — Training Job Configuration & Setup - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage enables users to create and configure a new LoRA training job through a streamlined, integrated workflow. Users select a training dataset from their library, choose from three scientifically-validated hyperparameter presets (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive), select GPU pricing tier (spot vs on-demand) with transparent cost trade-offs, view real-time cost estimates with budget validation, add optional metadata for organization, and review the complete configuration before starting the training job. The interface prioritizes simplicity, cost transparency, and confidence-building for proof-of-concept validation while maintaining core functionality for informed decision-making about expensive GPU training runs.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 1 User Goals:** 
  - First training job setup with guided configuration
  - Understanding dataset quality and training readiness
  - Making informed cost vs quality trade-off decisions
  - Transparent cost and time expectations before commitment
  - Building confidence in platform capabilities
  - Avoiding budget surprises and overages

- **Key Emotions:** 
  - Initial curiosity and exploration → Anxiety reduction through clear information → Confidence building through quality indicators and proven presets → Relief through upfront cost estimates → Trust in transparent pricing and budget controls → Final pre-commitment confidence through comprehensive review

- **Progressive Disclosure:** 
  - **Basic:** Simple selection interfaces (dropdown, radio cards, toggle) with essential metadata and total cost
  - **Advanced:** Quality score indicators, cost variance explanations, budget impact projections
  - **Expert:** (Removed for POC - expandable parameters, historical accuracy, optimization tips)

- **Persona Adaptations:** 
  - Unified interface serving all personas with visual quality indicators for non-technical users, simple preset names with success rates for business owners, and essential technical parameters for engineers without overwhelming detail

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable confident training file selection through simplified metadata display (name, conversation count, quality score)
- Guide hyperparameter configuration through three proven presets with clear cost/quality trade-offs
- Facilitate intelligent GPU selection (spot vs on-demand) with transparent cost comparison (70% savings vs guaranteed completion)
- Provide real-time cost estimation updating within 500ms of configuration changes
- Enforce monthly budget limits with clear validation feedback and actionable error messages
- Support basic job organization through auto-generated names and optional descriptions
- Build final confidence through comprehensive configuration review and explicit confirmation before expensive GPU provisioning

## Non-UI Acceptance Criteria

These backend requirements don't have direct UI but affect UI behavior:

| Criterion | Impact | UI Hint |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| System queries `training_files` table WHERE status='active' AND conversation_count >= 50 | Database query determines available files | UI receives filtered list from backend API |
| System validates file paths exist in storage | Backend check before job creation | UI shows storage status indicator if failed (not in POC) |
| System calculates duration: (conv_count × pairs × epochs × seconds_per_pair[preset]) / 3600 | Backend provides calculation | UI displays result in cost panel |
| System calculates cost: duration × hourly_rate[gpu_type] | Backend calculation | UI displays result, recalculates on changes |
| System stores job record with status='queued' | Database INSERT operation | UI shows loading spinner during creation |
| System redirects to `/training-jobs/{job_id}` after creation | Routing after successful job creation | UI navigates to job details page |
| Budget validation query: SELECT monthly_budget_limit, SUM(actual_cost) FROM... | Backend query for budget check | UI receives validation result (pass/fail) |
| Job name uniqueness check | Backend query for duplicates | UI shows warning (not error) if duplicate found (removed for POC) |

## Estimated Total Page Count

**12 wireframe pages** covering:

1. Configuration form - Empty state
2. Configuration form - File selected
3. Configuration form - Preset changed to Aggressive
4. Configuration form - GPU toggled to On-Demand
5. Configuration form - Metadata added
6. Configuration form - Complete valid
7. Configuration form - Budget exceeded error
8. Review modal - Initial display (unchecked)
9. Review modal - Checkboxes checked
10. Review modal - Edit configuration action
11. Mobile layout - Configuration form
12. Mobile layout - Review modal

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates complete user flow from empty → configured → reviewed → started
- Shows all key state changes (selections, updates, errors, validations)
- Covers both desktop (10 pages) and mobile (2 pages) layouts
- Includes primary success path and key error scenario
- Consolidates multiple individual FR pages into integrated workflow
- Removes redundant state demonstrations from original 34 pages
- Maintains all essential functionality while optimizing for POC speed
- **65% reduction** from original 34 pages to 12 pages through integration and simplification

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

### Integration Requirements
- All components on the main configuration page must be functional together as a single integrated interface
- Changing any input in Group 1 (file, preset, GPU) must update Group 2 (cost panel) in real-time with animation
- Budget validation must react to cost changes and dynamically block/unblock the review button
- Job name must auto-update when training file or preset changes, preserving user edits if made
- Review modal must accurately summarize all selections from the main page without duplication

### POC Simplifications Applied
**Removed features:**
- Preview conversations modal
- Expandable technical parameters for presets
- Interactive tooltips on every hyperparameter
- Historical accuracy metrics and charts
- Detailed cost breakdown (GPU compute, spot buffer, storage itemization)
- Budget increase workflow with approval routing
- Manager override system with justifications
- Tag system (multi-select with custom tag creation)
- Client/project assignment for cost attribution
- Markdown notes editor with preview
- Comparison to previous jobs in review modal
- Configuration template support
- Aggressive preset locked state for new users
- Context-aware recommendations based on job characteristics
- Spot availability warnings with datacenter utilization
- High-cost confirmation modal for on-demand selection

**Simplified features:**
- Metadata display: File name, conversation count, single quality score (not detailed breakdown)
- Preset details: Essential info only (name, description, cost, success rate, no expandable params)
- Cost breakdown: Total only (not itemized by component)
- Budget workflows: Simple pass/fail validation (no increase requests, overrides)
- Job metadata: Name and description only (no tags, projects, notes)
- Review modal: Basic summary with 2 checkboxes (not 3, fewer warnings)

### State Management
- Single source of truth for configuration state (unified JavaScript object)
- Reactive updates across all components when any input changes
- Debounced recalculations (500ms) for cost estimates to avoid excessive API calls
- Validation runs on every relevant state change (file selection, preset change, GPU change)
- Budget validation triggers whenever cost estimate updates

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation support (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape)
- Screen reader friendly with comprehensive ARIA labels and live regions
- High contrast colors meeting WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus indicators always visible (blue outline, never removed)
- Touch targets ≥44x44px for mobile accessibility
- Error messages announced immediately to screen readers (role="alert")
- Color never sole indicator (always paired with icon and text)

### Success Criteria
A user should be able to complete this workflow in 2-3 minutes:
1. Select a training file and see its basic details (name, count, quality)
2. Choose a preset and understand cost impact immediately
3. Toggle GPU type and see cost comparison (spot 70% cheaper)
4. Add optional metadata for organization
5. Review complete configuration summary with all costs and budget impact
6. Confirm understanding and start training job
7. Be redirected to job details page to track progress

All within a single, intuitive, integrated workflow that feels cohesive and builds confidence through transparent information disclosure at every step.
