## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 5 — Training Comparison & Optimization - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage enables AI engineers and technical leads to compare completed training runs, identify optimal configurations through data-driven analysis, and preserve successful setups as reusable templates. The interface consolidates training history browsing, side-by-side job comparison with overlaid loss curves, winner recommendation algorithms, and a template library for organizational knowledge building. The system prioritizes simplicity and proof-of-concept speed while maintaining core functionality for iterative training optimization and team knowledge sharing.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 5 User Goals:** Compare training experiments to identify best configurations, track team training history and success patterns, build reusable template library of proven setups, make data-driven decisions for production deployments
- **Key Emotions:** Confidence in optimization decisions, satisfaction from identifying winning configurations, pride in building team knowledge, excitement about continuous improvement
- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  * Basic: Browse training history, compare 2 jobs, start from template
  * Advanced: Filter/sort history, analyze comparison metrics, save custom templates
  * Expert: Configuration diff analysis, template analytics, team-wide pattern recognition
- **Persona Adaptations:** Unified interface serving AI engineers (comparison and optimization), technical leads (strategic configuration decisions), and team managers (knowledge preservation and best practices)

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable browsing complete training history with filtering by date, status, and preset
- Display key statistics (total jobs, success rate, total cost, total training hours) inline with history
- Support multi-select of 2 jobs for side-by-side comparison
- Show overlaid training and validation loss curves for visual comparison
- Present metrics comparison table highlighting best values in each category
- Provide algorithm-driven winner recommendation with clear rationale
- Enable saving winner configuration as reusable template
- Display template library with default and user-created templates
- Support starting new training jobs from templates with pre-filled configuration
- Provide template CRUD operations (create, view, edit, delete)

## Annotations (Mandatory)

Attach notes to UI elements in Figma citing:
1. **Which FR(s)** the element fulfills (e.g., "FR5.1.1 AC3: Overlaid loss curves")
2. **Acceptance criteria number** it maps to
3. **State variations** this element has

**Required Annotation Format:**
- Element Name: "FR5.X.X AC#: Description"
- Example: Overlaid Chart → "FR5.1.1 AC3: All selected jobs' loss curves on same chart, color-coded"

Include a **"Mapping Table"** frame in Figma with columns:
- **Criterion** (acceptance criterion text)
- **Source** (FR number)
- **Screen(s)** (which wireframe page)
- **Component(s)** (UI element name)
- **State(s)** (loading, active, error, etc.)
- **Notes** (implementation details)

**Example Annotation Entries:**
- Jobs Table: "FR5.2.1 AC4: Paginated table with sortable columns"
- Statistics Panel: "FR5.2.1 AC6 + FR5.1.2 simplified: Total jobs, success rate, total cost, training hours"
- Compare Selected Button: "FR5.1.1 AC1: Enabled when 2 jobs selected"
- Loss Curves Chart: "FR5.1.1 AC3: Overlaid training/validation curves, color-coded by job"
- Winner Card: "FR5.1.1 AC7: Algorithm-driven winner recommendation with rationale"

## Estimated Total Page Count

**8 wireframe pages** covering:
1. Training Hub empty state
2. Training Hub populated (default view)
3. Training Hub with jobs selected for compare
4. Comparison View full display
5. Template Creation Modal
6. Template Library grid view
7. Template Details Modal
8. Mobile responsive layout

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates complete user journey: browse history → compare jobs → save template → browse templates
- Shows all key state changes (empty, populated, selected, comparing, creating, browsing)
- Covers both desktop and mobile layouts
- Includes primary success path and key modal overlays
- Consolidates 4 original FRs (16 pages) into integrated 8-page workflow
- **50% page count reduction** while maintaining all essential functionality
- Optimized for POC speed while preserving core optimization and knowledge-building features

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

**Integration Requirements:**
- Training Hub serves as central entry point for all Stage 5 functionality
- Statistics panel updates when filters applied (not static)
- Multi-select in table triggers compare action bar appearance
- Comparison View accessible only via selection flow (not direct navigation)
- Template creation modal accessible from comparison winner
- Template Library accessible from Training Hub header
- "Start from Template" navigates to job creation with pre-filled config

**POC Simplifications Applied:**
- **Removed:** Compare 3-4 jobs, trend charts, team leaderboards, GPU heatmaps, failure pattern analysis
- **Simplified:** Analytics reduced to 4 key stats inline, template analytics reduced to key metrics
- **Maintained:** Core comparison flow, loss curve visualization, winner recommendation, template CRUD, pre-fill from template

**State Management:**
- Selected jobs tracked across Training Hub (persists during session)
- Comparison data loaded fresh when entering Comparison View
- Template library refreshes on return (shows newly created templates)
- Filters persist within session but reset on page refresh

**Accessibility:**
- Full keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader announcements for selection changes and success actions
- Color not sole indicator (paired with icons and text)
- Focus management in modals (trap + return to trigger)
- High contrast focus indicators

**Success Criteria:**
A user should be able to:
1. Browse training history with filters
2. Select 2 jobs and compare side-by-side
3. Identify winner with clear rationale
4. Save winner configuration as template
5. Browse template library
6. Start new job from template with pre-filled config

All within a cohesive, integrated workflow that builds organizational knowledge and enables data-driven training optimization.
