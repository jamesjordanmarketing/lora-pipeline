## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 2 — Training Job Execution & Monitoring - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage enables users to monitor and manage active LoRA training jobs through an integrated real-time dashboard. Users navigate from a comprehensive jobs list, view training progress with live-updating metrics and loss curves, track costs against estimates, observe stage progression through four training phases, access detailed event logs for troubleshooting, and control training through cancellation when needed. The interface prioritizes transparency, anxiety reduction, and cost visibility for proof-of-concept validation while maintaining essential monitoring capabilities for expensive GPU training runs that last 8-20 hours.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 2 User Goals:**
  - Monitor training job execution in real-time
  - Understand current training status with live metrics and loss curves
  - Confirm training is progressing correctly without errors
  - Track cost accumulation against estimates to prevent budget surprises
  - Identify problems early (stalled training, cost overruns, failed stages)
  - Cancel jobs when problems detected to save costs
  - Browse all training jobs and filter by status

- **Key Emotions:**
  - Anxiety reduction through transparency (eliminating "is it working?" fear)
  - Confidence building through visible progress and decreasing loss curves
  - Control through ability to monitor and intervene if needed
  - Relief when cost stays within estimates
  - Empowerment through detailed troubleshooting data

- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  - **Basic:** Progress percentage, current stage, loss trends, cost summary
  - **Advanced:** Detailed metrics with trend arrows, event log filtering, stage substatus messages
  - **Expert:** (Removed for POC - exportable graphs, historical comparisons, advanced analytics)

- **Persona Adaptations:**
  - Unified interface serving all personas with visual progress indicators for non-technical users, loss curve trends for technical leads, and cost tracking prominently displayed for budget managers

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable efficient job browsing through comprehensive jobs list with status filtering
- Provide at-a-glance training status assessment (healthy progress vs problems) in dashboard
- Visualize loss curve trends to confirm model is learning (decreasing loss over time)
- Display real-time metrics (training loss, validation loss, GPU utilization) with trend indicators
- Track cost accumulation with clear budget validation and warnings when exceeding estimates
- Show training phase progression through visual stage indicator (Preprocessing, Model Loading, Training, Finalization)
- Support detailed troubleshooting through event log with filtering by event type
- Enable rapid cost control through accessible job cancellation with confirmation workflow
- Provide queue visibility with position indicators and estimated start times

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

### Integration Requirements
- Jobs list provides navigation entry point to job dashboard
- Dashboard integrates Progress Header, Stage Indicator, Loss Curve, Metrics, Cost Tracker as unified view
- Event Log is separate tab but shares job context
- Cancel modal accessible from dashboard header
- Queue tab shares filter/search patterns with jobs list

### POC Simplifications Applied
**Removed:**
- FR2.2.2 Pause/Resume functionality (entire feature deferred)
- Loss curve pan controls and PNG export
- Detailed metrics (perplexity, tokens/sec, steps/hour)
- Event log keyword search and CSV export
- Jobs list bulk actions and CSV export
- Queue priority promotion and analytics
- Mobile-specific layouts (desktop-first for POC)

**Simplified:**
- Jobs list filtering to status and date range only
- Stage indicator to status display only (no expandable logs)
- Cost tracker to summary display (no itemized breakdown)
- Cancel modal to required fields only (no notes field)
- Event log to single-select filter (no multi-select)

### State Management
- Jobs list polls every 60s for active job status updates
- Dashboard polls every 60s for metrics, 10s for events
- Queue polls every 30s for position updates
- Polling stops when job reaches terminal state (completed/failed/cancelled)
- Manual refresh available for immediate updates

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop (>1024px): Two-column dashboard layout
- Tablet (768-1023px): Stacked single-column layout
- Mobile (<768px): Simplified single-column with collapsible sections
- Jobs table adapts with hidden columns on smaller screens

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader announcements for dynamic updates
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Color not sole indicator (icons + text accompany status colors)
- High contrast focus indicators

### Success Criteria
A user should be able to:
1. Browse all training jobs and filter by status
2. View queue position and estimated start time
3. Monitor active training with real-time progress and metrics
4. Observe loss curve trends confirming model improvement
5. Track cost against estimate throughout training
6. Access event log for troubleshooting when needed
7. Cancel training job when problems detected
8. View completed/failed job results and partial data

All within an integrated, cohesive monitoring experience that reduces anxiety and builds confidence during expensive 8-20 hour training runs.

**Estimated Total Page Count: 15 wireframe pages**

Covering:
- Jobs list and queue views (5 pages)
- Dashboard overview states (7 pages)
- Event log views (2 pages)
- Cancel confirmation modal (1 page)

**Original FR page count:** 33 pages across 7 FRs
**Combined & simplified:** 15 pages (55% reduction)

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates complete monitoring workflow from jobs list → dashboard → cancel
- Shows key states: normal, loading, warning, completed, failed
- Covers queue management with position and estimates
- Includes essential troubleshooting (event log)
- Maintains all critical functionality for POC validation
- Removes advanced features and mobile layouts for faster implementation
