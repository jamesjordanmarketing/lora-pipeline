## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 3 — Error Handling & Recovery - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage covers comprehensive error handling and recovery for LoRA fine-tuning training jobs. When training fails due to Out of Memory (OOM) errors, dataset validation issues, GPU provisioning failures, or spot instance interruptions, the system detects issues, provides clear explanations, and offers quick recovery paths. The interface transforms technical failures into actionable moments, guiding users from problem understanding to successful resolution with minimal friction. Users can retry with intelligent configuration adjustments, resume from checkpoints, or switch infrastructure options—all designed to maintain confidence and minimize wasted time and cost.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 3 User Goals:** Monitor training execution, understand what went wrong when failures occur, quickly recover from errors, learn to prevent repeat failures, maintain confidence in system reliability
- **Key Emotions:** Anxiety reduction through clear explanations, confidence building with actionable guidance, relief at quick recovery options, trust in automatic recovery systems
- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  * Basic: Error message with primary fix button (one-click resolution)
  * Advanced: Configuration adjustment options, cost comparisons, recovery strategies
  * Expert: Detailed analytics, pattern tracking, historical data (removed for POC)
- **Persona Adaptations:** Serves AI engineers and operations managers with accessible language, technical depth available on-demand, focus on fast recovery over detailed analysis

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable immediate understanding of any training error (OOM, data, provisioning, interruption)
- Provide one-click or two-click recovery paths for every error type
- Display clear status during automatic recovery processes
- Allow strategic configuration adjustments when resuming failed jobs
- Track and display interruption/recovery history at a glance
- Maintain cost transparency through recovery decisions
- Support responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing

**Explicit UI Requirements**

**Non-UI Acceptance Criteria**

| Criterion | Impact | UI Hint |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| OOM detection in training logs | Triggers modal display | System detects within 60 seconds |
| VRAM calculation engine | Provides data for display | Server-side calculation |
| Job status database update | Enables UI status badges | Immediate update on failure |
| Checkpoint saving every 100 steps | Enables resume option | Stored in cloud storage |
| Interruption webhook handling | Triggers recovery UI | Webhook → status update |
| GPU provisioning retry logic | Background attempts | UI shows progress |
| Retry job creation workflow | Creates new job record | Response in <3 seconds |
| Job continuation linking | Enables "view original" | Database relationship |
| Cost calculation for estimates | Real-time updates | 300ms update delay |
| Success rate calculation | Informs confidence badges | Historical data query |

**Estimated Total Page Count**

**12 wireframe pages** covering:
1. OOM error modal with recommended fix
2. Dataset validation error with fix guidance
3. GPU provisioning error with recovery options
4. Auto-retry progress display
5. Spot interruption recovery in progress
6. Successful recovery with interruption badge
7. Recovery failure with fallback options
8. Resume configuration modal
9. Retry confirmation with suggested fix
10. Job dashboard with error/recovery states
11. Mobile error modal layout
12. Mobile job dashboard layout

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates complete error handling flow from detection to resolution
- Covers all 7 FR categories in consolidated, integrated design
- Shows all key state transitions (error → recovery → success)
- Includes both automatic (interruption) and user-initiated (retry/resume) recovery
- Provides mobile responsive views for complete coverage
- Reduces original 40 pages to 12 by consolidating similar patterns
- Maintains all essential functionality while removing advanced/expert features
- Enables rapid POC validation of core error handling UX

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

**Integration Requirements:**
- All error modals share consistent header/footer structure
- Recovery options are context-aware based on error type
- Cost estimates update in real-time when configuration changes
- Status badges reflect current job state accurately
- Interruption/retry indicators persist across sessions
- Mobile layouts adapt gracefully from desktop designs

**POC Simplifications Applied:**
- Removed: VRAM breakdown charts, multi-option comparisons, educational content
- Removed: Tabbed error modals, JSON viewers, quality scores
- Removed: Proactive warnings, quota management, team analytics
- Removed: Detailed interruption timelines, loss curve markers
- Removed: Configuration diff viewers, multiple fix selection
- Simplified: Single recommended fix instead of ranked options
- Simplified: Basic config adjustment (GPU + batch only)
- Simplified: Badge summaries instead of full modals

**State Management:**
- Error detection triggers appropriate modal immediately
- Recovery progress tracked and displayed in real-time
- Status badges update automatically on state changes
- Cost estimates recalculate on any configuration change
- Interruption counts persist and increment correctly

**Accessibility:**
- Full keyboard navigation throughout
- Screen reader announcements for all critical state changes
- Color-independent status indication
- Adequate touch targets for mobile

**Success Criteria:**
A user experiencing any training error should be able to:
1. Understand what went wrong in <10 seconds
2. See a clear recovery path with 1-2 options
3. Execute recovery with 1-2 clicks
4. Monitor progress during automatic recovery
5. Complete successful retry/resume within reasonable time
6. Track error history via badges and indicators

All within a cohesive, integrated system that handles OOM errors, dataset issues, GPU provisioning, and spot interruptions consistently.
