## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 6 — Model Quality Validation - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage enables users to validate trained LoRA model quality through comprehensive automated evaluation across four dimensions: perplexity improvement (technical quality), emotional intelligence benchmarks (EI quality), financial knowledge retention (safety validation), and brand voice consistency (personality alignment). Engineers can view objective quality metrics, identify improvement areas, receive actionable recommendations, and make confident delivery decisions. The interface prioritizes clear quality gate visualization with progressive disclosure of detailed analysis.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 6 User Goals:** Validate model quality objectively, demonstrate measurable improvements, ensure no knowledge degradation, confirm brand personality acquisition, make confident delivery decisions
- **Key Emotions:** Anticipation during validation, relief/pride when metrics pass, concern requiring action if issues detected, confidence for client delivery
- **Progressive Disclosure:** 
  * Basic: Combined quality scorecard with pass/fail indicators for each dimension
  * Advanced: Expanded sections with dimension breakdowns and top examples
  * Expert: Detailed drill-downs, before/after comparisons, full metric analysis
- **Persona Adaptations:** AI Engineers see technical metrics and debugging context; Business Owners see executive summaries and ROI proof; Quality Analysts see detailed validation methodology

**Wireframe Goals**

- Display combined quality scorecard showing all validation metrics at a glance
- Provide perplexity improvement visualization with quality tier classification (FR6.1.1)
- Show category-level perplexity analysis with best/worst performers (FR6.1.2)
- Present emotional intelligence benchmark results with dimension breakdown (FR6.2.1)
- Alert users to EI regression issues with affected scenario count (FR6.2.2)
- Display financial knowledge retention test results with topic breakdown (FR6.3.1)
- Show domain-specific knowledge acquisition validation (FR6.3.2)
- Present brand voice consistency scoring with personality dimension analysis (FR6.4.1/6.4.2)
- Enable quality gate decision workflow (approve/review/block)
- Support export of comprehensive validation report combining all metrics

7. Dashboard - Critical Error State
8. Before/After Example Modal
9. Export Report Preview Modal
10. Mobile Responsive Layout

**Rationale:**
- Consolidates 8 individual FR displays (24 pages) into unified dashboard (10 pages) - **58% reduction**
- Shows complete validation flow through expandable sections
- Covers all key states (success, warning, error)
- Includes both desktop and mobile layouts
- Provides modal for detail views without separate full screens
- Maintains all essential functionality while optimizing for POC

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

**Integration Requirements:**
- Combined scorecard always visible at top, providing at-a-glance quality status
- Four validation sections must work independently (expand/collapse) while contributing to overall score
- Quality gate footer always visible, adapts based on combined metrics
- Export generates comprehensive report including all sections

**POC Simplifications Applied:**
- Removed: Team analytics, persona×arc heatmap, all 50 scenarios view, root cause analysis, compliance workflows, multiple brand profiles
- Simplified: Category analysis to top/bottom 3, before/after to top 3, trend charts removed, approval workflows condensed
- Maintained: All 4 core validation dimensions, quality tier classification, actionable recommendations, export functionality

**State Management:**
- Each section tracks own expanded/collapsed state
- Combined scorecard computes overall status from 4 dimension scores
- Quality gate footer reacts to combined assessment
- Conditional elements (regression alert, voice drift) appear based on metric results

**Accessibility:**
- Full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly with ARIA labels and live regions
- Color never used alone for meaning (always paired with text/icons)
- Focus indicators visible on navigation
- Modals trap focus appropriately

**Success Criteria:**
A user should be able to:
1. View combined quality scorecard showing all validation metrics
2. Expand any section to see detailed analysis
3. Understand quality tier for each dimension (production-ready, warning, blocked)
4. View before/after examples demonstrating model improvements
5. See actionable recommendations for any issues detected
6. Export comprehensive validation report
7. Make informed delivery decision based on quality gates

All within a single, integrated validation dashboard that provides progressive disclosure from overview to detail.
