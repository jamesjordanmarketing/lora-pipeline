## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 7 — Cost Management & Budget Control - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage enables engineers and budget managers to monitor training costs in real-time, track monthly budget consumption, receive proactive alerts when approaching limits, and attribute costs to clients and projects for financial planning. The interface prioritizes transparency through live cost tracking, proactive warnings through threshold-based alerts, and simplicity through consolidated dashboards that combine cost monitoring, projections, and budget controls into intuitive, integrated workflows.

The POC focuses on the essential cost visibility loop: monitor active job costs → view monthly budget status → receive alerts → basic cost attribution. Advanced features like scenario analysis, multi-channel notifications, and profitability calculations are simplified or removed for faster implementation.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 7 User Goals:** Monitor real-time training costs, maintain budget awareness, make informed continuation decisions, prevent surprise overages, track costs by client/project
- **Key Emotions:** Anxiety reduction through cost transparency, confidence in budget control, empowerment through immediate action capability
- **Progressive Disclosure:** 
  * Basic: Current spend vs estimate with visual status indicator
  * Advanced: Cost breakdown, projected completion, budget trend analysis
  * Expert: Per-job analysis, spot savings comparison, attribution reports
- **Persona Adaptations:** Unified interface serving AI engineers (primary cost monitoring during training) and budget managers (monthly oversight, attribution)

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable real-time cost visibility during active training jobs with 60-second updates
- Provide immediate visual feedback on budget status using color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Display projected final costs and completion times to inform continuation decisions
- Present comprehensive monthly budget overview with summary cards and trend visualization
- Enable proactive budget control through threshold-based warning banners (80%, 95%, 100%)
- Support cost attribution by tagging jobs with client and project for financial reporting
- Show spot instance savings compared to on-demand pricing

## Annotations (Mandatory)

Attach notes to UI elements in Figma citing:
1. **Which FR(s)** the element fulfills (e.g., "FR7.1.1 AC3: Current spend display")
2. **Acceptance criteria number** it maps to
3. **State variations** this element has

Include a **"Mapping Table"** frame in Figma with columns:
- **Criterion** (text of acceptance criterion)
- **Source** (FR number)
- **Screen(s)** (which wireframe page numbers)
- **Component(s)** (UI element name)
- **State(s)** (loading, error, success, etc.)
- **Notes** (implementation details, simplifications for POC)

## POC Simplifications Applied

**Removed from original FRs:**
- ❌ Three-scenario projection analysis (best/expected/worst case)
- ❌ Projection timeline and cost trajectory charts
- ❌ Historical accuracy tracking by preset/GPU
- ❌ Multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, SMS)
- ❌ Approval workflow for budget increases
- ❌ Audit log for budget changes
- ❌ 6-month historical comparison
- ❌ Budget period type selection
- ❌ Alert threshold configuration
- ❌ Job blocking toggle
- ❌ Interruption impact analysis
- ❌ ROI projections and strategic recommendations
- ❌ Project profitability calculations
- ❌ Pricing insights dashboard
- ❌ Budget allocation by client priority
- ❌ Create New Client/Project forms

**Simplified:**
- 🔽 Cost breakdown: Only GPU + overhead (removed per-phase breakdown)
- 🔽 Projections: Single expected value (removed scenario analysis)
- 🔽 Budget settings: Only limit change (removed period, thresholds, blocking)
- 🔽 Spot analysis: Summary + basic table (removed histogram, ROI)
- 🔽 Attribution: By Client only (removed By Project, profitability)
