## Prompt for Figma Make AI

**Title:** Stage 4 — Model Artifacts & Downloads - Complete Integrated Wireframe System

**Context Summary**

This stage provides users with comprehensive access to all training job outputs and deliverables after successful training completion. Users can download trained LoRA adapters in convenient ZIP format, manage storage and versioning, export detailed training metrics in CSV or JSON format for analysis, generate professional PDF reports for client presentations, and download complete deployment packages with inference scripts and documentation. The interface prioritizes immediate access to tangible training outcomes, transparent artifact management, and professional deliverables that transform training investment into deployable assets and client-ready documentation.

**Journey Integration**

- **Stage 4 User Goals:** 
  - Download trained LoRA adapters for immediate use
  - Access complete training metrics for analysis and validation
  - Generate professional reports for client deliverables
  - Obtain deployment-ready packages for production integration
  - Manage storage efficiently across multiple training runs
  - Share training outcomes with stakeholders securely

- **Key Emotions:** 
  - Relief (training succeeded, tangible results) → Satisfaction (deliverables ready) → Confidence (quality validated, metrics accessible) → Professionalism (client-ready reports) → Eagerness (deployment-ready packages)

- **Progressive Disclosure:** 
  - **Basic:** One-click downloads with essential metadata (file sizes, package contents)
  - **Advanced:** Format selection for exports, preview options, storage management
  - **Expert:** (Removed for POC - bulk operations, cost projections, API templates)

- **Persona Adaptations:** 
  - AI Engineers need quick adapter downloads and deployment packages for integration
  - Quality Analysts need CSV exports for spreadsheet analysis and validation
  - Business Owners need PDF reports for client presentations and professional deliverables
  - Technical Leads need storage oversight and deployment package management

**Wireframe Goals**

- Enable immediate one-click download of trained LoRA adapters with progress feedback
- Provide transparent storage metadata and simple artifact management
- Support flexible metrics export in CSV or JSON format
- Generate professional PDF reports with preview and sharing capabilities
- Deliver complete deployment packages with inference scripts and documentation
- Indicate upcoming API template features without blocking current workflow
- Handle large file downloads (200-700MB) with clear progress indicators
- Maintain secure access with signed URL expiration and regeneration

## Final Notes for Figma Implementation

**Integration Requirements:**
- All sections appear on single Job Details page for completed jobs
- Download buttons trigger progress modals for large files
- Export modal allows format selection before download
- Report generation shows progress before preview
- Share link modal captures secure link distribution
- Delete confirmation prevents accidental data loss

**POC Simplifications Applied:**
- Removed: Download history tables, README previews, bulk operations, cost projections, chart embedding, full PDF viewer, detailed API template wireframes
- Simplified: Storage dashboard to summary only, export to format selection only, report preview to thumbnail only
- Maintained: Core downloads with progress, format selection, report generation, share links, confirmation modals

**State Management:**
- Job status determines button availability (completed → enabled)
- Link expiration tracked with countdown
- Download/export counters update after successful operations
- Report generated status enables share link button

**Accessibility:**
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for progress and status changes
- High contrast colors and visible focus indicators
- Touch-optimized button sizes

**Success Criteria:**
A user should be able to:
1. Download trained adapters with progress feedback
2. View storage details and delete if needed
3. Export metrics in preferred format (CSV/JSON)
4. Generate and preview professional PDF reports
5. Share reports via secure expiring links
6. Download complete deployment packages
7. Understand API templates are coming soon

All within a unified Job Details page where Stage 4 outputs are organized into clear, accessible sections.
