# Progressive Structured Specification Builder - System Summary

## What Was Created

I've built a complete system for transforming **any unstructured technical specification** into a **progressive, cumulative structured specification** where each section explicitly builds upon previous sections with zero redundancy.

---

## 🎯 The Problem This Solves

### Your Original Issue:
You ran into granularity problems with FigMa prompts because the raw input specification (`iteration-8-LoRA-pipeline-figma-conversion.md` - 3307 lines) was too unstructured for one prompt to properly segment.

### The Root Cause:
Unstructured specs don't clearly show:
- What builds on what
- Which components are reused vs newly created
- How sections integrate with each other
- What's foundational vs what's extended functionality

### The Solution:
A meta-prompt template + script that transforms unstructured specs into structured specs where:
- **Section 2** explicitly states: "Uses `ComponentX` from Section 1"
- **Section 3** explicitly states: "Extends `APIEndpointY` from Section 2, adds new field Z"
- **Section 4** explicitly states: "Integrates `ComponentX` (Section 1) with `APIEndpointY` (Section 2)"

## 🚀 How To Use (Quick Version)

### Step 1: Run Script
```bash
cd pmc/product/_tools
node 04c-generate-structured-spec-prompt.js
```

### Step 2: Provide Paths
- **Input**: Point to your unstructured spec (e.g., `iteration-8-LoRA-pipeline-figma-conversion.md`)
- **Output**: Where Claude will save structured version (e.g., `lora-structured-spec.md`)

### Step 3: Get Prompt File
Script generates: `_run-prompts/04c-build-structured-spec-prompt-[timestamp].md`

### Step 4: Use in Claude
1. Open generated prompt file
2. Copy ENTIRE contents
3. Paste into Claude Sonnet 4.5 (200k context)
4. Claude analyzes and creates progressive structured spec
5. Save Claude's output to path from Step 2

### Step 5: Done!
You now have a structured spec where every section explicitly builds on previous work.

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### Traditional Unstructured Spec:
```markdown
# Feature List

## Dataset Management
- Upload datasets
- Validate format
- Store in database
- Show dataset list

## Training Configuration
- Select dataset
- Configure hyperparameters
- Estimate cost
- Start training

## Training Monitor
- Show progress
- Display metrics
- Show cost
```

**Problems**:
- How does "Select dataset" in Training Configuration relate to "Show dataset list" in Dataset Management?
- Are they using the same component? Same API? Same data structure?
- Is "Show cost" in Training Monitor the same as "Estimate cost" in Training Configuration?
- **Result**: Developers guess, duplicate code, break integrations

### Progressive Structured Spec:
```markdown
## Section 1: Dataset Management Foundation

### FR-1.1.1: Dataset Upload Component
- Component: `DatasetUploadForm`
- Location: `/src/components/datasets/DatasetUploadForm.tsx`
- API: `POST /api/datasets`
- Returns: `Dataset` type (id, name, format, size, created_at)
- State: Stores in `datasets` table with columns: [schema]

### FR-1.2.1: Dataset List Display
- Component: `DatasetList`
- Location: `/src/components/datasets/DatasetList.tsx`
- API: `GET /api/datasets`
- Returns: `Dataset[]` (using type from FR-1.1.1)
- Displays: Uses `DatasetCard` sub-component for each dataset

---

## Section 2: Training Configuration with Dataset Selection

### Builds Upon:
- Section 1, FR-1.1.1: `Dataset` type - Used for type safety in selection
- Section 1, FR-1.2.1: `DatasetList` component - Reused for selection interface
- Section 1, API `GET /api/datasets` - Called to populate selector

### FR-2.1.1: Dataset Selector for Training
- Component: `TrainingDatasetSelector`
- Location: `/src/components/training/DatasetSelector.tsx`
- **Extends**: `DatasetList` from Section 1, FR-1.2.1
- **Enhancement**: Adds radio buttons for single-selection (original was view-only)
- **Integration**: On selection, stores `selectedDatasetId` in form state
- Props:
  ```typescript
  interface TrainingDatasetSelectorProps {
    onSelect: (dataset: Dataset) => void; // Dataset type from Section 1
  }
  ```

### FR-2.2.1: Cost Estimation API
- Endpoint: `POST /api/training/estimate-cost`
- Request:
  ```typescript
  {
    datasetId: string; // References Dataset.id from Section 1
    hyperparameters: TrainingConfig; // NEW type defined in this section
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```typescript
  {
    estimatedCost: number;
    estimatedDuration: number;
    datasetSize: number; // Retrieved from Section 1's datasets table
  }
  ```
- **Integrates With**: 
  - Section 1, `datasets` table - Reads dataset.size for calculation
  - NEW: Creates `cost_estimates` table for tracking estimates

---

## Section 3: Training Execution with Live Monitoring

### Builds Upon:
- Section 1, FR-1.1.1: `Dataset` type - Training job references dataset
- Section 2, FR-2.1.1: `TrainingDatasetSelector` - Used in job creation flow
- Section 2, FR-2.2.1: Cost estimation API - Results shown before job start
- Section 2, `TrainingConfig` type - Stored with job in database

### FR-3.1.1: Training Job Creation
- API: `POST /api/training/jobs`
- Request:
  ```typescript
  {
    datasetId: string; // From Section 1, Dataset.id
    config: TrainingConfig; // From Section 2
    costEstimate: CostEstimate; // From Section 2, FR-2.2.1 response
  }
  ```
- **Integration Points**:
  - Validates `datasetId` exists (calls Section 1's `GET /api/datasets/:id`)
  - Stores `config` (type from Section 2)
  - Creates foreign key to `datasets` table (Section 1)
- **NEW Table**: `training_jobs`
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE training_jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    dataset_id UUID REFERENCES datasets(id), -- From Section 1
    config JSONB, -- TrainingConfig from Section 2
    estimated_cost NUMERIC, -- From Section 2's cost estimation
    status TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
  );
  ```

### FR-3.2.1: Live Cost Tracking Display
- Component: `CostTracker`
- Location: `/src/components/training/CostTracker.tsx`
- **Integrates**:
  - Section 2, FR-2.2.1: Displays `estimatedCost` from cost estimation
  - NEW: Fetches real-time `actualCost` from `GET /api/training/jobs/:id/cost`
  - NEW: Shows comparison: "Actual: $23.45 / Estimated: $25.00 (93%)"
- **Enhancement**: 
  - Adds color coding (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%)
  - Uses same cost calculation logic as Section 2, but with actual elapsed time
```

**Key Differences**:
- ✅ Every reused component is explicitly named and cited
- ✅ Every extension is clearly marked with what's NEW vs inherited
- ✅ Every API integration shows exact endpoints and data types
- ✅ Every database relationship is documented with foreign keys
- ✅ **Zero ambiguity about what builds on what**

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Automatic Section Determination
The template doesn't force a predetermined structure. Instead, it instructs the AI to:
1. Read the ENTIRE unstructured spec first
2. Analyze features, dependencies, and user flows
3. **Determine optimal sections** based on content (not predetermined count)
4. Create section plan with rationale before generating details

**Result**: 
- Small specs → 4-5 sections
- Medium specs → 6-8 sections
- Large specs → 9-12 sections
- Sections naturally group related functionality

### 2. Explicit Integration Documentation
Every section after Section 1 MUST include:

**"Builds Upon"** block listing:
- Section number referenced
- Specific requirement ID (FR-X.Y.Z)
- Exact component/API/type name in backticks
- How it's used or extended

**Example**:
```markdown
### Builds Upon:
- Section 1, FR-1.2.3: `UserAuth` service - Used for permission checks
- Section 2, FR-2.1.4: `DatasetValidator` - Extended to support new format
- Section 3, FR-3.3.1: `TrainingJob` type - Added new fields: pausedAt, resumedAt
```

### 3. NEW vs INHERITED Clarity
For every component, API, or data model that extends previous work:

```typescript
// INHERITED FROM Section 2:
interface BaseConfig {
  learningRate: number;
  batchSize: number;
}

// NEW IN THIS SECTION:
interface AdvancedConfig extends BaseConfig {
  // Inherited: learningRate, batchSize
  // NEW fields:
  warmupSteps: number;
  gradientClipping: number;
}
```

### 4. Wireframe-Level UI Specifications
Every UI component includes:
- ASCII layout diagram
- Component hierarchy with sources (Section X, Component Y)
- All interactive elements with actions
- State management (local vs global, where it comes from)
- Data flow (which API from which section)
- Loading, error, and success states
- Responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility requirements

**Result**: Developers can build UI directly from spec without guessing

### 5. Complete API Integration Documentation
Every API endpoint includes:
- Request/response schemas with type sources
- "Integrates With" section listing other APIs called
- "Depends On" section listing data models from previous sections
- Business logic flow showing step-by-step integration
- Side effects (what else is updated/triggered)

**Result**: Developers know exactly which APIs call which, preventing circular dependencies

### 6. Database Relationship Clarity
Every table includes:
- NEW fields vs INHERITED fields (if extending)
- Foreign keys with explicit section references
- Indexes with justification (benefits Section X queries)
- Migration dependencies (must run after Section Y migration)

**Result**: Database migrations are properly ordered, relationships are clear

### 7. Cumulative Testing Strategy
Every section includes:
- Unit tests for NEW functionality
- Integration tests with PREVIOUS sections
- Regression tests ensuring previous functionality still works
- E2E tests covering flows from Section 1 through current section

**Result**: Building Section 5 doesn't break Section 2

### 8. Final Integration Validation
After all sections, a final section provides:
- Integration matrix showing all cross-section connections
- Complete end-to-end user flows across all sections
- System-wide testing strategy
- Complete API reference (consolidated)
- Complete data model (consolidated)
- Complete component library (consolidated)

**Result**: Proof that all sections form a cohesive system

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Your Immediate Need: LoRA Training Platform
**Input**: `iteration-8-LoRA-pipeline-figma-conversion.md` (3307 lines, unstructured)
**Expected Output**: 6-8 progressive sections, each building explicitly on previous work
**Time to Generate**: 5-10 minutes in Claude
**Time Saved**: 40+ hours of manual structuring + countless hours saved from avoiding duplication

### 2. Future Projects
This system works for **any** unstructured specification:
- Product requirements documents
- Technical architecture documents
- API documentation
- Feature specifications
- System design documents

**The template is project-agnostic** - it works by analyzing content, not by following project-specific rules.

## 🔍 What's Different from Traditional Approaches

### Traditional "Structured" Specs:
```
Section 1: Authentication
Section 2: User Management
Section 3: Dashboard
Section 4: Reports
```

**Problems**:
- Does Dashboard use components from User Management? Which ones?
- Does Reports API call User Management API? How?
- If I change User Management, what breaks in Dashboard and Reports?
- **Answer**: You don't know until you read all sections carefully

### Progressive Structured Specs:
```
Section 1: Authentication
  - Defines: AuthContext, UserSession, login API

Section 2: User Management
  - Uses: AuthContext (Section 1) for permissions
  - Uses: UserSession (Section 1) for current user
  - Extends: UserSession with profile fields
  - NEW: UserProfile component, user management APIs

Section 3: Dashboard
  - Uses: AuthContext (Section 1) for auth check
  - Uses: UserProfile (Section 2) for display
  - Enhances: UserProfile with quick stats overlay
  - Calls: GET /api/users/current (Section 2)
  - NEW: DashboardStats component, stats API

Section 4: Reports
  - Uses: AuthContext (Section 1) for auth check
  - Calls: GET /api/users/:id (Section 2) for report ownership
  - Calls: GET /api/dashboard/stats (Section 3) for report data
  - NEW: ReportGenerator component, report APIs
```

**Benefits**:
- Crystal clear dependency graph
- Know exactly what breaks if you change Section 2
- Can implement sections in order without rework
- New developers understand system architecture instantly
- Code reviews can verify specs match implementation
