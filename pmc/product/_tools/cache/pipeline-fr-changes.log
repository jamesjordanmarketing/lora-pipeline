# Functional Requirements Organization - Change Log
**Date:** 2025-12-16
**Document:** pmc/product/03-pipeline-functional-requirements.md
**Version:** 2.0.0 (Reorganized)
**Reorganization Task:** Senior Technical Product Manager Review

================================================================================
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

### Quantitative Summary
- **Total Original FRs:** 51
- **FRs Removed (non-product):** 0
- **FRs Merged (duplicates):** 1 (FR8.2.2 merged into FR7.2.2)
- **Persona Consolidations:** 0
- **Final FRs:** 50
- **Sections:** 8 (maintained)

### Key Changes
1. Fixed section header formatting (removed duplicate numbering in all 8 sections)
2. Merged duplicate FR8.2.2 (Budget Alert Notifications) into FR7.2.2 (Budget Alerts & Notifications)
3. Consolidated acceptance criteria from US8.2.2 into FR7.2.2
4. Renumbered Section 8 FRs to close gap left by merge:
   - FR8.3.1 → FR8.2.2 (Job Notes and Experiment Documentation)
   - FR8.3.2 → FR8.3.1 (Team Knowledge Base Integration)
5. Maintained existing logical build order which already follows dependencies

### Organizational Philosophy Applied
- Current structure already reflects natural build dependencies
- Feature-based organization (vs strict technical layers) better serves this specific project
- Maintained 8 sections to preserve existing cross-references and team familiarity
- Focused on eliminating redundancy while preserving completeness

================================================================================
## PHASE 1: Non-Product Requirements Analysis
================================================================================

### Analysis Method
Reviewed all 51 FRs against criteria:
- Does it specify buildable software functionality?
- Are acceptance criteria testable and implementable?
- Does it affect the product build directly?

### Analysis Results
After systematic review:
- **All FRs directly affect product functionality**
- No purely business/marketing requirements found
- Impact weightings contain business language but acceptance criteria are product-specific
- All acceptance criteria are testable, measurable, and buildable
- Even analytics/reporting FRs (FR5.1.2, FR7.3.1, FR7.3.2) require building dashboards, reports, and data aggregation features

**NON-PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS REMOVED: 0**

**RATIONALE:** All requirements specify buildable functionality with testable acceptance criteria. No business-only metrics that don't require product development.

================================================================================
## PHASE 2: Duplicate Requirements Analysis
================================================================================

### Analysis Method
Cross-referenced all 51 FRs looking for:
- Exact duplicates (same functionality, same acceptance criteria)
- Near-duplicates (significant overlap requiring consolidation)
- Complementary features (different timing/context, keep separate)

### Potential Duplicates Examined

#### FR1.2.1 vs FR7.1.1 (Cost Tracking)
- **FR1.2.1:** Real-Time Cost Estimation
  - Timing: BEFORE training starts (during configuration)
  - Purpose: Help user make informed decision about starting job
  - Context: Configuration form, pre-job
- **FR7.1.1:** Live Cost Accumulation Display
  - Timing: DURING training execution
  - Purpose: Monitor actual spending while job runs
  - Context: Job dashboard, active training
- **DECISION: KEEP BOTH - COMPLEMENTARY**
- **RATIONALE:** Different timing, different context, different user needs. FR1.2.1 is estimation for planning, FR7.1.1 is real-time tracking for monitoring.

#### FR1.2.2 vs FR7.2.1 (Budget Management)
- **FR1.2.2:** Pre-Job Budget Validation
  - Timing: BEFORE job starts
  - Purpose: Block job creation if budget exceeded
  - Context: Configuration, gate-keeping
- **FR7.2.1:** Monthly Budget Dashboard
  - Timing: ANY time
  - Purpose: View budget status, history, forecasts
  - Context: Budget management page, reporting
- **DECISION: KEEP BOTH - COMPLEMENTARY**
- **RATIONALE:** Different purposes. FR1.2.2 is validation/gate, FR7.2.1 is dashboard/reporting.

#### FR8.2.1 vs FR8.2.2 (Notifications)
- **FR8.2.1:** Training Completion Notifications
  - Triggers: Training complete, failed, cancelled, interrupted
  - Content: Job status, metrics, results
  - Purpose: Notify about training events
- **FR8.2.2:** Budget Alert Notifications
  - Triggers: Budget thresholds (80%, 95%, 100%)
  - Content: Budget status, spending, forecasts
  - Purpose: Notify about budget events
  - **CROSS-REFERENCE:** US8.2.2 says "See US7.2.2 for detailed budget alert specifications"
- **DUPLICATE DETECTED:** FR8.2.2 duplicates FR7.2.2
- **FR7.2.2:** Budget Alerts & Notifications
  - Already specifies: Alert triggers, channels, content, escalation
  - Missing: Recipient configuration, escalation levels, daily digest
- **DECISION: MERGE FR8.2.2 into FR7.2.2**
- **RATIONALE:** Same notification system, same triggers. FR8.2.2 acceptance criteria should be part of FR7.2.2.

### MERGE DECISION: FR8.2.2 → FR7.2.2

[GROUP-001] Budget Alert Notifications
- **FR7.2.2** (Budget Alerts & Notifications) | PRIMARY | KEEP
- **FR8.2.2** (Budget Alert Notifications) | DUPLICATE | MERGE INTO FR7.2.2

**ACTION:** Merge FR8.2.2 acceptance criteria into FR7.2.2

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA CONSOLIDATED:**

From FR7.2.2 (Original):
- Alert Triggers (80%, 95%, 100% thresholds)
- Alert Channels (Email, Slack, In-app)
- Alert Content (spending, remaining, forecast, actions)
- Increase Budget Limit workflow
- Budget Override Log/audit trail

From FR8.2.2 (Merged):
- Notification Recipients configurable (budget manager, finance team, operations)
- Escalation Levels: 80% → email, 95% → email + Slack, 100% → email + Slack + in-app banner
- Daily digest option: "Your daily training budget summary"

**USER STORY REFERENCES:**
- FR7.2.2 now maps to: US7.2.2, US8.2.2
- Tasks: [T-7.2.2], [T-8.2.2]

**DUPLICATES MERGED: 1** (FR8.2.2 merged into FR7.2.2)

================================================================================
## PHASE 3: Persona Consolidation Analysis
================================================================================

### Personas Identified
From User Journey Document:
1. **Alex Chen - AI Engineer / Technical Lead** (Primary)
   - Daily user, configuration and monitoring
   - Intermediate technical expertise
   
2. **Maria Rodriguez - Business Owner / Founder** (Secondary)
   - Strategic user, validation and ROI
   - Business-focused, non-technical

3. **Dr. Sarah Kim - Quality Analyst / QA Team** (Supporting)
   - Validation user, quality assurance
   - Intermediate expertise

### Consolidation Rules Applied
From requirements:
- When personas have similar needs → Create single comprehensive FR
- When personas conflict → Create base FR with progressive disclosure
- When persona is unique → Note as advanced configuration

### Analysis Results
Reviewed all 51 FRs for persona-specific variations:
- **All FRs already consolidate personas through progressive disclosure**
- No persona-specific FR variations requiring consolidation
- Multiple personas served through single comprehensive FRs
- Example: FR6.2.1 (Emotional Intelligence Benchmarks) serves:
  - AI Engineer: Run validation, view technical metrics
  - Business Owner: View executive summary, share with clients
  - Quality Analyst: Detailed scoring, approve/reject delivery

### Personas Already Properly Served
- **AI Engineer / Technical Lead (Power User)** - Primary configuration/monitoring FRs
- **Business Owner / Founder (Decision Maker)** - Quality reports/cost visibility FRs
- **Quality Analyst / QA Team (Validation User)** - Validation benchmarks/reports FRs
- **Budget Manager / Operations (Financial Oversight)** - Budget dashboards/alerts FRs

**PERSONA-SPECIFIC FRs CONSOLIDATED: 0**

**RATIONALE:** Document already follows consolidation pattern. All FRs serve multiple personas appropriately through progressive disclosure and role-based views.

================================================================================
## PHASE 4: Build Order & Dependencies Analysis
================================================================================

### Logical Build Layers Defined
From requirements guidance:
- A. Foundation Layer - Core config/setup, base architecture
- B. Infrastructure Layer - Data management, service architecture, error handling
- C. Base Components Layer - Shared components, core layouts, UI elements
- D. Primary Features Layer - Main user workflows, essential functions
- E. Advanced Features Layer - Complex workflows, advanced capabilities
- F. Cross-Cutting Layer - Performance, security, budget, notifications

### Current Structure Validation

**Section 1: Training Job Configuration & Setup** (PRIMARY FEATURES - Entry Point)
- FR1.1.1 → FR1.1.3: Job creation and configuration
- FR1.2.1 → FR1.2.2: Cost estimation and budget validation
- FR1.3.1 → FR1.3.2: Metadata and final review
- **Dependencies:** None (starting point for all other features)

- FR8.1.1 → FR8.1.2: Job attribution and sharing
- FR8.2.1: Training completion notifications
- FR8.2.2 → FR8.3.1: Job notes and knowledge base (renumbered)
- **Dependencies:** Section 2 (job management and events)
- **Build Layer:** CROSS-CUTTING (team features)

### Build Order Decision

**DECISION:** Keep existing 8-section structure

**RATIONALE:**
1. Current structure already follows logical build dependencies:
   - Configuration (Section 1) MUST come before Execution (Section 2)
   - Execution MUST come before Error Handling (Section 3)
   - Artifacts (Section 4) require completed training
   - Comparison (Section 5) requires multiple jobs
   - Validation (Section 6) requires artifacts
   - Budget/Collaboration (Sections 7-8) are cross-cutting
   
2. Feature-based organization better serves this project type:
   - Training pipeline has natural workflow progression
   - Developers think in terms of user journeys, not technical layers
   - Existing structure matches how team discusses features
   
3. Maintaining 8 sections preserves:
   - Existing cross-references in documentation
   - Team familiarity with structure
   - Traceability to User Stories
   
4. No significant dependency violations detected:
   - No features in later sections required by earlier sections
   - Cross-cutting concerns (budget, notifications) appropriately placed

**BUILD ORDER VALIDATION: PASSED** - No reorganization required beyond formatting and duplicate removal.

================================================================================
## PHASE 5: Section Header Formatting Fixes
================================================================================
