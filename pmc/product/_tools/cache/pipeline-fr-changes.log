# Functional Requirements Organization - Change Log
**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Document:** pmc/product/03-pipeline-functional-requirements.md
**Version:** 2.0 (Reorganized)
**Task:** iteration-6-temporary-functional_v1.md

================================================================================
## SUMMARY
================================================================================

### Quantitative Summary
- **Total Original FRs:** 51
- **FRs Removed (non-product):** 0
- **FRs Merged (duplicates):** 1 (FR8.2.2 merged into FR7.2.2)
- **Persona Consolidations:** 0
- **Final FRs:** 50
- **Sections:** 8 (unchanged)

### Key Changes
1. Fixed section header formatting (removed duplicate numbers)
2. Merged duplicate FR8.2.2 (Budget Alert Notifications) into FR7.2.2 (Budget Alerts & Notifications)
3. Maintained existing logical build order which already follows dependencies
4. Renumbered Section 8 FRs to close gap left by merge

================================================================================
## PHASE 1: Non-Product Requirements Analysis
================================================================================

### Analysis Results
After reviewing all 51 FRs, the following observations were made:
- All FRs directly affect product functionality
- No purely business/marketing requirements found
- Impact weightings contain business language but acceptance criteria are product-specific
- All acceptance criteria are testable and buildable

**NON-PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS REMOVED: 0**

REASON: All requirements specify buildable functionality with testable acceptance criteria.

================================================================================
## PHASE 2: Duplicate Requirements Analysis
================================================================================

### Analysis Results
After cross-referencing all FRs:
- No exact duplicates found except one notification system overlap
- Budget alert notifications appear in two contexts (FR7.2.2 and FR8.2.2)

### MERGE DECISION:
[GROUP-001] Budget Alert Notifications
- **FR7.2.2** (Budget Alerts & Notifications) | KEEP as primary
- **FR8.2.2** (Budget Alert Notifications) | MERGE into FR7.2.2

**ACTION:** Merge FR8.2.2 acceptance criteria into FR7.2.2
**REASON:** Both specify the same notification system with same triggers; FR8.2.2 adds notification recipient configuration and escalation levels which should be part of FR7.2.2

### Merged Acceptance Criteria for FR7.2.2:
From FR7.2.2 (Primary):
- Alert triggers (80%, 95%, 100% thresholds)
- Alert channels (Email, Slack, In-app)
- Alert content and actions
- Budget limit increase workflow
- Budget override log/audit trail

From FR8.2.2 (Merged):
- Notification recipients configurable (budget manager, finance team, operations)
- Escalation levels: 80% → email, 95% → email + Slack, 100% → email + Slack + in-app banner
- Daily digest option for training budget summary

**DUPLICATES MERGED: 1** (FR8.2.2 merged into FR7.2.2)

================================================================================
## PHASE 3: Persona Consolidation Analysis
================================================================================

### Analysis Results
Reviewing all FRs for persona-specific variations:
- Most FRs already consolidate personas through progressive disclosure
- No persona-specific FR variations requiring consolidation
- Multiple personas served through single comprehensive FRs

### Personas Already Properly Served:
- AI Engineer / Technical Lead (Power User) - Primary configuration/monitoring
- Business Owner / Founder (Decision Maker) - Quality reports/cost visibility
- Quality Analyst / QA Team (Validation User) - Validation benchmarks/reports
- Budget Manager / Operations (Financial Oversight) - Budget dashboards/alerts

**PERSONA-SPECIFIC FRs CONSOLIDATED: 0**

REASON: Document already follows consolidation pattern; all FRs serve multiple personas appropriately.

================================================================================
## PHASE 4: Build Order Analysis

================================================================================
## PHASE 6: FR Renumbering
================================================================================

### Sections 1-7: No Changes
All FR numbers in Sections 1-7 remain unchanged as they follow consistent numbering scheme.

### Section 8: Renumbered Due to Merge
[FR8.1.1] -> [UNCHANGED] -> [FR8.1.1] | Job Creator Attribution
[FR8.1.2] -> [UNCHANGED] -> [FR8.1.2] | Job Sharing & Collaboration
[FR8.2.1] -> [UNCHANGED] -> [FR8.2.1] | Training Completion Notifications
[FR8.2.2] -> [MERGED INTO FR7.2.2] -> REMOVED | Budget Alert Notifications
[FR8.3.1] -> [RENUMBERED] -> [FR8.2.2] | Job Notes and Experiment Documentation
[FR8.3.2] -> [RENUMBERED] -> [FR8.3.1] | Team Knowledge Base Integration (Future)

### Renumbering Rationale
- FR8.3.1 → FR8.2.2: Moved up to fill gap left by merged FR8.2.2
- FR8.3.2 → FR8.3.1: Moved up to maintain sequential numbering
