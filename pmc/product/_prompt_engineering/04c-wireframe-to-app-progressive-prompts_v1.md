# Meta-Prompt Template: Unstructured Specification to Progressive Build Prompts

**Version:** 0.1  
**Date:** December 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Transform any unstructured specification into a series of progressive, integrative build prompts  
**Target Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (200k context window)  
**Output Format:** Standalone, executable prompts that build incrementally without redundancy

---

## Overview

This meta-prompt template analyzes unstructured technical specifications and generates a series of progressive build prompts. Each prompt is designed to be executed in a fresh Claude Sonnet 4.5 window with 200k token context, building upon previous work in an explicit, integrative manner.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Progressive Build**: Each prompt builds on previous implementations explicitly
2. **No Redundancy**: Features are implemented once and referenced thereafter
3. **Standalone Execution**: Each prompt is self-contained with all necessary context
4. **Explicit Integration**: Clear references to previous prompts and their deliverables
5. **Adaptive Complexity**: Number of prompts determined by specification complexity

---

## Input Requirements

When using this template, you will receive:

### Required Input
- **SPECIFICATION_DOCUMENT**: The unstructured specification to be implemented
  - Path: `{SPECIFICATION_DOCUMENT_PATH}`
  - Format: Any (markdown, text, HTML, etc.)
  - Content: Technical requirements, architecture, features, etc.

### Optional Context (if available)
- **ORIGINAL_WIREFRAME**: Existing wireframe or prototype (if converting/migrating)
  - Path: `{WIREFRAME_PATH}` (if applicable)
- **EXISTING_CODEBASE**: Current implementation (if extending/refactoring)
  - Path: `{CODEBASE_PATH}` (if applicable)
- **RELATED_DOCS**: Supporting documentation (architecture, APIs, etc.)
  - Paths: `{RELATED_DOCS_PATHS}` (if applicable)

---

## Phase 1: Specification Analysis

Before generating any prompts, you must analyze the specification document thoroughly.

### Step 1.1: Document Structure Analysis

Read the entire specification and identify:

1. **Document Organization**
   - Table of contents structure
   - Major sections and subsections
   - Hierarchical relationships
   - Cross-references and dependencies

2. **Content Classification**
   - Executive summaries and overviews
   - Technical requirements
   - Implementation details
   - Database schemas
   - API specifications
   - UI/UX requirements
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment requirements

3. **Complexity Assessment**
   ```
   For each major section, rate complexity:
   - LOW: Simple, straightforward implementation (1-2 hours)
   - MEDIUM: Moderate complexity, some integration (3-6 hours)
   - HIGH: Complex, multiple dependencies (7-12 hours)
   - CRITICAL: Core architecture, high risk (12+ hours)
   ```

### Step 1.2: Dependency Mapping

Create a dependency graph:

1. **Component Dependencies**
   - What depends on what?
   - What must be built first?
   - What can be built in parallel?
   - What requires previous work to be completed?

2. **Data Flow Dependencies**
   - Database schema requirements
   - API endpoint dependencies
   - Authentication requirements
   - State management needs

3. **Integration Points**
   - Frontend ↔ Backend connections
   - External service integrations
   - Third-party library dependencies
   - Infrastructure requirements

### Step 1.3: Feature Inventory

Enumerate all features and components:

1. **Core Features** (must-have for MVP)
2. **Secondary Features** (important but not blocking)
3. **Enhancement Features** (nice-to-have improvements)
4. **Infrastructure** (database, auth, deployment)

For each feature, identify:
- Dependencies (what must exist first)
- Deliverables (what files/components will be created)
- Acceptance criteria (how to verify completion)
- Integration requirements (what it connects to)

### Step 1.4: Risk Assessment

Identify high-risk areas:

1. **Technical Risk**
   - Complex algorithms
   - Performance-critical sections
   - Security-sensitive areas
   - External integrations

2. **Integration Risk**
   - Multiple systems interacting
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - State management complexity
   - Cross-cutting concerns

3. **Scope Risk**
   - Ambiguous requirements
   - Incomplete specifications
   - Multiple valid approaches
   - Potential scope creep

---

## Phase 2: Prompt Sequence Planning

Based on your analysis, determine the optimal sequence of prompts.

### Step 2.1: Determine Prompt Count

**Formula for Initial Estimate:**
```
Base Prompts = CEIL(Total Complexity Hours / 8)
Adjustment Factors:
  + 1 if extensive database schema required
  + 1 if complex authentication system
  + 1 if real-time features required
  + 1 if multiple external integrations
  + 1 if migration from existing system
  
Total Prompts = Base Prompts + Adjustment Factors
Typical Range: 3-12 prompts for most projects
```

### Step 2.2: Logical Grouping Strategy

Group implementation tasks using these patterns:

**Pattern A: Layer-Based (Traditional Full-Stack)**
1. Foundation & Infrastructure (DB, Auth, Config)
2. Backend Core (API Routes, Business Logic)
3. Frontend Foundation (Layout, Navigation, State)
4. Feature Set 1 (Related features grouped)
5. Feature Set 2 (Related features grouped)
6. Integration & Polish (Real-time, Testing, Optimization)

**Pattern B: Vertical Slice (Feature-Driven)**
1. Foundation & Infrastructure
2. Feature 1 (Full Stack - DB to UI)
3. Feature 2 (Full Stack - DB to UI)
4. Feature 3 (Full Stack - DB to UI)
5. Integration & Polish

**Pattern C: Migration-Based (Legacy → New)**
1. New Architecture Setup
2. Core Infrastructure Migration
3. Data Model Migration
4. Feature Migration (Batch 1)
5. Feature Migration (Batch 2)
6. Cutover & Cleanup

Choose the pattern that best fits the specification and document your reasoning.

### Step 2.3: Define Prompt Boundaries

For each prompt, explicitly define:

```markdown
### Prompt N: [Descriptive Name]

**Purpose:** [One sentence describing what this prompt accomplishes]

**Prerequisites:**
- Prompt 1 deliverables: [List specific files/features from Prompt 1]
- Prompt 2 deliverables: [List specific files/features from Prompt 2]
- ... (continue for all previous prompts)

**Scope:**
- IN SCOPE: [Specific features, files, components to implement]
- OUT OF SCOPE: [What this prompt does NOT do]
- INTEGRATES WITH: [What from previous prompts this builds upon]

**Deliverables:**
- [Specific file paths and components]
- [Database changes, if any]
- [API endpoints, if any]
- [UI components, if any]

**Validation:**
- [How to verify this prompt's work is complete]
- [Integration tests to run]
- [Acceptance criteria to check]
```

### Step 2.4: Integration Strategy

For each prompt after Prompt 1, specify:

1. **What to Reuse** (from previous prompts)
   - Existing components to import
   - Existing APIs to call
   - Existing utilities to leverage
   - Existing patterns to follow

2. **What to Extend** (building upon previous work)
   - Components to enhance
   - APIs to expand
   - Features to complete
   - Patterns to apply

3. **What to Integrate** (connecting new to old)
   - How new features connect to existing ones
   - Data flow between old and new components
   - Shared state management
   - Navigation updates

## Phase 3: Prompt Generation

Now generate each prompt using this exact structure.

### Prompt Template Structure

## 🗄️ Database Requirements

[If this prompt requires database changes]

### Schema Changes

```sql
-- Tables to create or modify
-- Mark each statement as [NEW] or [MODIFY]

[NEW] CREATE TABLE table_name (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id),
  field_name type CONSTRAINTS,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

[MODIFY] ALTER TABLE existing_table

3. **Integration Check**
   - Does each prompt properly reference previous work?
   - Are integration points clearly defined?
   - Is the data flow between prompts clear?

4. **Dependency Check**
   - Are prompts in the correct order?
   - Does any prompt require something not yet built?
   - Are circular dependencies avoided?
