make me sound qualified lol


find markets where my identity as solo business owner (hopefully not solo much longer) who is not a LLM or tech degree holder will realistically be able to give customers the faith and trust they need to "try" me

Where my sk match my expertise and skillset

do we need a "before" data set. I.e. to automatically generate lots of answers from a "vanilla" llm to then be able to match against our fine tuned answers



**This is your pitch:** "We generate structured, domain-grounded training data 10x faster than custom annotation, at 1/10th the cost, with automated quality scoring."


If our  market is other LLM/ML/Fine Tuning/ professionals what are they looking for. Important because they are the "canary in the goal mine". If we produce something good they 
already believe in AI as a force for good, and if we can impress them they will do our selling for us to other domains.
