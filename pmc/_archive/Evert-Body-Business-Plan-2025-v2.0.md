**1\. Executive Summary**

Every Body is an emerging apparel brand dedicated to providing stylish, high-quality, and well-fitting branded clothing for big and tall members of sororities. Founded by Jamien Jordan, an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (AKA), Every Body addresses a significant gap in the current sorority apparel market. 

While existing vendors offer a range of branded items, these offerings often fail to cater to the diverse body types within sororities, particularly neglecting plus-size and tall women. Our product strategy is rooted in a deep understanding of fit, focusing on specific cuts like V-necks, tunics, and wrap styles that flatter a range of plus-size and tall figures.

Every Body will not compete in the general commodity apparel market. Instead, it will operate as an adjunct brand, leveraging established relationships and direct marketing channels within sororities. 

Our initial focus will be on serving the members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, offering a curated collection of apparel that features official branding and is designed specifically for big and tall physiques. Success within AKA will pave the way for expansion to other sororities facing similar inclusivity challenges in their apparel options.

The core mission of Every Body is to ensure that every sorority member, regardless of size, can proudly and comfortably wear her organization's letters and represent her sisterhood with confidence.

**2\. Company & Business Description**

### **The Problem We Solve**

Jamien Jordan, a dedicated and involved member of her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, has consistently observed a frustrating reality within the sorority apparel landscape. While there are established vendors providing branded clothing (t-shirts, dresses, jackets, etc.), these options rarely include adequate sizing for big and tall women. 

Sorors who require larger or taller sizes are often left with limited, ill-fitting, or no choices when it comes to representing their beloved organization through apparel.

This isn't just a matter of clothing; it's a matter of inclusion and representation. The inability to find branded items that fit well can make members feel overlooked and unable to fully participate in the visual culture of their sisterhood. 

Current vendors, while vetted, often have a one-size-fits-most approach that doesn't serve the entirety of the membership.

Jamien's insight is that there's a dedicated, passionate group of women who desire to purchase high-quality, officially branded apparel that is designed for their bodies. They are not looking for the cheapest option but for items that make them feel good and look good while representing their sorority.

### **Company Purpose**

Every Body aims to be the premier provider of high-quality, stylish, and officially branded apparel for big and tall members of sororities nationwide. We will begin by serving Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, and plan to expand to other Greek letter organizations based on demand and opportunity.

For sorority members, Every Body:

* Provides access to a range of apparel that finally fits them comfortably and beautifully.  
* Allows them to express their sorority pride without compromising on style or fit.  
* Offers a sense of belonging and recognition within their organization's apparel offerings.  
* Ensures they have appropriate attire for sorority events, conferences, and everyday wear.

Founded and based in Austin, TX, Every Body is focused on celebrating every body type within the cherished bonds of sisterhood.

### **Mission/Vision Statement**

**Our Mission:** To empower sorority women of all sizes by providing beautifully designed, high-quality, and perfectly fitting branded apparel, ensuring every sister can wear her letters with pride and confidence.

**Our Vision:** To be the leading and most trusted apparel partner for sororities seeking inclusive and stylish solutions for their members, fostering a culture where every body is celebrated.

### **Core Values**

* **Sisterhood:** We operate with a deep respect for the traditions, values, and bonds of sorority life.

### **Team & Org Structure**

* **Jamien Jordan (Founder & CEO):** Jamien is an active and well-connected member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Her intimate understanding of sorority culture, apparel needs, and the specific challenges faced by big and tall members is the cornerstone of Every Body. She will initially oversee product design input, marketing, sales, and relationship management with sorority contacts and future vendor partners.  
* **Future Roles (to be developed):** As the business grows, roles will include a Design & Production Manager, a Marketing & Social Media Coordinator, and a Customer Service & Operations Lead.

### **Action Items (Initial)**

1. Finalize initial product designs for the AKA collection (e.g., 3-5 core items).  
2. Source and vet manufacturers with demonstrated expertise in producing specific plus-size and tall silhouettes, such as peplum, ruched, and dolman-sleeve styles, as detailed in our product line.  
3. Secure necessary permissions/licensing from Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. for use of branding.  
4. Develop prototype tech packs based on our fit research for testing with the target demographic.  
5. Establish an e-commerce platform.  
6. Create a pre-launch marketing strategy leveraging Jamien's network.

**3\. Product & Services Line**

### **Product Design Philosophy: The Every Body Difference**

Our core competitive advantage lies not just in offering extended sizing, but in our commitment to a superior fit based on a deep understanding of plus-size and tall bodies. We will move beyond the standard practice of simply grading up smaller patterns. Instead, our design process begins with what is most flattering and comfortable for our customer. This detailed knowledge will be the foundation of our product specifications and will be a key qualifier when selecting manufacturing partners. Vendors must demonstrate their capability to execute these specific design features accurately in extended size ranges.

### **Product Offering(s)**

Every Body will offer a curated line of apparel, with the initial collection focused on Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

**A. T-Shirts & Casual Tops – The Foundation of Our Fit Strategy:**

Our initial t-shirt collection will feature a variety of styles designed to flatter different body shapes within the plus-size category. These specifications will be central to our vendor technical packets:

* **V-Neck T-Shirts:** To create a vertical line that elongates the neck and slims the upper body, ideal for members with larger busts or fuller faces.  
* **Scoop Neck T-Shirts:** To soften the neckline, draw attention upward, and balance broader shoulders.  
* **Peplum or Empire-Waist T-Shirts:** To define the waist and flow away from the midsection and hips, perfect for apple, rectangle, or pear shapes.  
* **Tunic-Length T-Shirts:** To offer stylish coverage for hips and the midsection, designed with side slits or asymmetrical hems to provide structure and movement.  
* **Ruched or Wrap-Style T-Shirts:** To create or define a waistline and camouflage midsection concerns through flattering fabric gathering.  
* **Dolman or Batwing Sleeve Tops:** To add volume to the upper body without clinging, creating an hourglass silhouette that tapers at the hips.  
* **Structured Boxy Tees:** To offer a modern, casual shape that is cropped or structured appropriately to avoid adding bulk, paired best with high-waisted bottoms.  
* **Side-Slit or High-Low Hem T-Shirts:** To prevent clinging around the hips, add visual interest, and create an elongating effect.

**B. Other Core Apparel:**

* **Blazers & Jackets:** Professionally styled blazers and fashionable jackets (e.g., bomber jackets, line jackets) suitable for meetings, conferences, and chapter events, tailored for a flattering fit on larger and taller frames.  
* **Dresses & Skirts:** Versatile dresses and skirts appropriate for sorority functions, from rituals to social gatherings, designed with consideration for proportions of big and tall women.  
* **Sweatshirts & Loungewear:** Cozy and chic sweatshirts, hoodies, and loungewear sets for everyday comfort and sorority pride.

### **Service Offerings**

While primarily a product-based business, Every Body will offer services that enhance the customer experience:

* **Fit Guidance:** Providing detailed size charts, fit guides, and potentially personalized advice to help customers choose the correct sizes.  
* **Pre-Orders & Limited Editions:** Offering pre-order opportunities for new collections or limited-edition items to gauge demand and create excitement.  
* **Pop-Up Shops:** Organizing pop-up shops at sorority conferences, regional meetings, and other relevant events to allow for in-person Browse, trying on, and purchasing.

### 

### **Pricing Model**

Every Body will adopt a premium pricing strategy. Our products are not mass-produced commodity items but specialized apparel catering to an underserved niche with a focus on quality, fit, and official branding. Pricing will reflect the higher costs associated with producing smaller, specialized batches of clothing and ensuring a superior fit. Our value will be communicated through product quality and the unique solution we provide.

**4\. Market Analysis**

### **Target Market**

Our primary target market consists of big and tall women who are members of sororities, including both collegiate and alumnae members. Our initial focus is on members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated who wear plus sizes (e.g., sizes 16/XL and above) and/or require tall sizing. These women are proud of their sorority affiliation, active in their communities, and are willing to invest in quality items that fit well and make them feel good.

### **Core Buyer Personas for "Every Body"**

These three personas represent the high-value core of the "Every Body" customer base. They are not price-sensitive; they are **quality, fit, and status-sensitive.** They value exclusivity, exceptional materials, and a brand that understands their lifestyle and accomplishments.

### **Persona 1: The Power Professional**

**Name:** Dr. Althea Washington

**Title:** Chief of Surgery & "Silver Soror" (25+ years of service)

**Quote:** *"My schedule is non-negotiable, and so is my appearance. When I represent my sorority, I need to look as polished and command as much respect as I do in the operating room. I don't have time for anything less than excellence."*

**Demographics:**

* **Age:** 52  
* **Income:** \~$750,000/year  
* **Location:** Atlanta, GA  
* **Profession:** Surgeon and hospital department head.  
* **Family:** Married, two adult children.  
* **Body Type:** Plus-size (Size 18), values a structured, powerful silhouette.

**Her Story & Sorority Role:** Althea pledged AKA in college and has remained a financially active and influential alumna ever since. She doesn't have time for weekly chapter meetings but sits on the board of the sorority's national foundation and is a major donor. Her involvement is at the leadership and philanthropic level. She mentors younger sorors in the medical field and often speaks at leadership conferences.

**Goals (What she wants):**

* To project an image of authority, competence, and sophisticated elegance at all times.  
* To find high-quality, impeccably tailored branded apparel for national meetings, fundraising events, and mentorship functions.  
* To be able to make a purchase decision quickly and trust that the quality and fit will be perfect, saving her precious time.

**Frustrations (Her Pains):**

* **Lack of Professionalism:** Existing sorority paraphernalia is often too casual or "cutesy," completely misaligned with her professional stature.  
* **Poor Fit & Quality:** Standard plus-size options are often boxy and made from cheap synthetics. They don't have the structure or drape she expects from high-end clothing.  
* **Time Sink of Custom:** Getting custom items made is the only current solution, but it requires multiple fittings and significant time she doesn't have.

**Watering Holes (Where to find her):**

* **Online:** LinkedIn, Sermo (a network for doctors), private AKA Facebook groups for professionals, reading the Wall Street Journal and Forbes.  
* **Offline:** AKA Boulé (national convention), medical association conferences, high-end charity galas, the Capital City Club in Atlanta.

**How "Every Body" Wins Her Business:** Offer a **"Professional Collection"** featuring structured blazers in premium wool, tailored sheath dresses in high-quality ponte knit, and chic blouses in silk blends—all with subtle, elegant AKA branding (e.g., a small, embroidered crest on a cuff). Emphasize the investment-quality of the pieces and offer a seamless online ordering experience with concierge-level customer service.

### **Persona 2: The Civic Leader**

**Name:** Councilwoman Regina Beauvais

**Title:** City Councilwoman & Philanthropist

**Quote:** *"My life is a series of public-facing events, from a gala on Friday night to a community cleanup on Saturday morning. I am always 'on,' and I am always representing my family and my sorority. I need a wardrobe that is as versatile and hard-working as I am."*

**Demographics:**

* **Age:** 63  
* **Assets:** High net worth (married into wealth, significant family assets).  
* **Location:** Houston, TX  
* **Profession:** Elected official and sits on the boards of three major non-profits.  
* **Family:** Married to a prominent business leader, three grown children.  
* **Body Type:** Plus-size and tall (Size 22T), requires longer hemlines and sleeve lengths.

**Her Story & Sorority Role:** Regina is a community pillar. Her AKA affiliation is a key part of her public identity, symbolizing a lifelong commitment to service. She chairs major fundraising committees for her chapter and leverages her vast social and political network to support the sorority's initiatives. She is highly visible and frequently photographed at events.

**Goals (What she wants):**

* To maintain a polished, appropriate, and stylish public image that reflects her status and her sorority's values.  
* To find elegant, branded apparel that is comfortable enough for long days of events and versatile enough to transition between different functions.  
* To support businesses, especially those run by fellow sorors, that demonstrate excellence and an understanding of her lifestyle.

**Frustrations (Her Pains):**

* **The "Tall Tax":** It's nearly impossible to find items that are both plus-size and tall, especially in the niche world of sorority gear. Everything is too short.  
* **Lack of Versatility:** Items are either extremely casual (T-shirts) or overly formal, with nothing in between for a luncheon, community meeting, or upscale brunch.  
* **Gaudy Branding:** Much of the available apparel has oversized, loud branding that feels inappropriate for the sophisticated events she attends.

**Watering Holes (Where to find her):**

* **Online:** Facebook (sharing community news and photos), local political and society blogs, charity and foundation websites.  
* **Offline:** City Hall, The Links, Incorporated meetings, Jack and Jill of America events, her church, exclusive fundraising dinners, AKA Regional Conferences where she is often a keynote speaker.

**How "Every Body" Wins Her Business:** Offer a **"Socialite Collection"** featuring items like elegant twinsets in cashmere blends, versatile A-line dresses, and chic tunic tops in luxurious fabrics. The branding should be tasteful and understated. Highlight the availability of true tall sizes and create lookbooks showing how to style one piece for multiple types of civic and sorority events.

### **Persona 3: The Legacy Matriarch**

**Name:** Soror Evelyn Dubois

**Title:** Retired Educator & "Golden Soror" (50+ years of service)

**Quote:** *"I have worn these letters with pride for over fifty years. At this stage, comfort is my priority, but I refuse to sacrifice elegance. I've earned the right to have both."*

**Demographics:**

* **Age:** 74  
* **Assets:** Retired with significant assets (\> $5M), including pension and investments.  
* **Location:** Washington, D.C.  
* **Profession:** Retired High School Principal.  
* **Family:** Widowed, two children, five grandchildren.  
* **Body Type:** Plus-size (Size 20W), prioritizes ease of movement and soft, non-restrictive fabrics.

**Her Story & Sorority Role:** Evelyn is the revered matriarch of her chapter. She is a living link to the sorority's history and is deeply respected for her wisdom and decades of service. While she no longer holds official positions, her opinion carries immense weight. She attends social events, rituals, and milestone celebrations, where her presence is an honor. She is a mentor to generations of women, including her own daughter and granddaughter who are also AKAs.

**Goals (What she wants):**

* To be comfortable, elegant, and appropriate at all sorority functions.  
* To find beautifully made, premium-quality apparel that is easy to wear and care for.  
* To purchase from a brand that respects the traditions and legacy of the organization.

**Frustrations (Her Pains):**

* **Comfort vs. Style:** She is forced to choose between comfortable but frumpy items (like standard unisex sweatshirts) and stylish but restrictive formalwear.  
* **Poor Quality Materials:** She is appalled by the cheap polyester and rough cotton used in most standard paraphernalia. Her skin is more sensitive now, and she desires soft, natural fibers.  
* **Lack of Sophistication:** Most designs are targeted at younger women and lack the timeless grace she seeks.

**Watering Holes (Where to find her):**

* **Online:** Primarily uses Facebook to keep up with family and sorority sisters from her era. Enjoys reading her chapter's email newsletter.  
* **Offline:** Her AKA chapter's monthly "Golden Sorors" brunch, church services, family gatherings, anniversary celebrations for her line sisters, relaxing at her upscale retirement community.

**How "Every Body" Wins Her Business:** Offer a **"Legacy Collection"** focused on luxurious comfort. This would include items like machine-washable cashmere-blend cardigans, pima cotton knit tops, and relaxed-fit pants in high-end jersey. The fit would be looser but exquisitely draped. Branding would be minimal and classic. Emphasize the use of premium, natural fibers and timeless design. This collection says "quiet luxury" and pays homage to her distinguished service.

### **Location Analysis**

Every Body will operate primarily as an e-commerce business, which minimizes overhead. Our sales reach is nationwide, shipping to customers across the United States. We will also plan for a strategic physical presence through pop-up shops at key sorority events (e.g., Boulé, Regional Conferences) in various major cities, allowing for direct interaction with our target market without the cost of permanent retail space.

* **Competitor Name:** Existing Vetted Sorority Vendors

  * **Comparative Weakness(es):** Severely limited or no sizing for big and tall women; styles are often generic or outdated in available larger sizes.

Every Body will be established as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) to offer personal liability protection. The official name will be "Every Body Apparel, LLC."

### **Legal Considerations**

This is a critical area requiring diligent attention:

1. **Licensing and Trademarks:** Securing official licensing agreements with Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (and any subsequent sororities) to legally use their names, letters, crests, and other insignia is our top legal priority. We will strictly adhere to all requirements for becoming an approved vendor.  
2. **Intellectual Property:** We will trademark the "Every Body" brand name and logo.  
3. **Supplier Agreements:** We will use clear contracts with manufacturers that outline quality standards, production timelines, and payment terms.
